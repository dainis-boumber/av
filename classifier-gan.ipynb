       "[Text xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ xxmaj english , my xxmaj english ! xxmaj xxunk ones strengths and weaknesses in any situation is a hard task . xxmaj usually we are not so good at xxunk our strengths , instead we spend our time being critical of ourselves , thus we tend to present a much more detailed side of our flaws . i will try to give you a reasonable picture of my good and not quite as good sides , as i see them , in reference to the four skills that were mentioned in the guide - lines handed out earlier in regard of this essay . y biggest weakness by far is reading in xxmaj english . i most of the time find it quite boring , it probably has to do with the fact that i 'm a very outgoing person and therefore i like meeting people and i prefer to converse with them . a contributing factor to my feelings about reading also has to do with the fact that i 'm just not used to it , which makes reading a bit uncomfortable . xxmaj it takes time to read and it is not by far as fun as actually talking with someone . xxmaj you miss out on facial expressions and the dialogue for example . xxmaj it 's not that i ca n't manage , i just do n't find it all that amusing , at times . xxmaj this leads too the fact that i more or less skim through anything written in xxmaj english , which ultimately results in my xxunk . xxmaj but i am indeed working on that partly since it is required in order to be able to teach but also for my own benefit . i have been known to read books in xxmaj english on occasion though . xxmaj preferably novels taking place during the nineteenth century when in my personal opinion the xxmaj english language was at its best . i think it 's terrible that we 've lost so much of the chivalry , the sence of class and style that one can encounter in for example xxmaj jane xxmaj xxunk ' \" xxmaj pride & xxmaj prejudice \" , or the vocabulary used in xxmaj xxunk works . xxmaj this brings us to the speaking , which i believe is one of my strongest features , not only when it comes to speaking xxmaj english , but speaking in general . i admit that it sometimes does get out of hand . xxmaj you see , in my previous xxmaj english classes i 've always been the one to speak my opinion and discuss things that are important to me . xxmaj this might and actually has lead to the fact that others who are not as forward as i am just sit quiet and on top of that they 're doing absolutely nothing to change or take any kind of initiative to speak . xxmaj this xxunk me , should i keep holding back to suit them or should i allow myself the xxunk to improve and broaden my horizons ! ? xxmaj in this class though it does n't seem to be a thing that even needs to be discussed , since everybody is fairly good in xxmaj english , and not at all shy . i do know how and when to use a very formal vocabulary , but i tend to disregard that at times when i get \" too comfortable \" with the person i 'm addressing , it 's not a lack of respect or anything of that nature , i just get too \" buddy - xxunk \" . i think that speaking a lot helps me improve all the aspects of xxmaj english , writing , reading , listening but most importantly to communicate in any given situation . xxmaj my desire to communicate enables people in my everyday life to correct me when i 'm wrong and vice versa . i believe there are two kinds of xxmaj english students . xxmaj the ones that learn the language by using grammar and dictionaries and school - xxmaj english , not that there is anything wrong with that . xxmaj in fact i think it 's a good start , a solid base to begin at . xxmaj and then the others , much like myself , who learn by actually speaking , conversing and therefore picking up a rich vocabulary . xxmaj both have advantages and disadvantages . i 've learned my xxmaj english by speaking , practising and perhaps xxunk by listening to others . xxmaj listening is also one of my strengths . xxmaj for this is where i learn and adapt . i like watching news , documentaries or whatever is on in xxmaj english . xxmaj if i 'm lucky i might even catch one of xxmaj david xxmaj xxunk ' \" wild - life - documentaries \" . xxmaj he has an elegant vocabulary and intonation . xxmaj although i must say that if it were possible to choose i 'd pick one of the people behind the series of \" xxmaj the young ones \" , preferably xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj but i 'm not xxunk to listening to sports either , as long as it is xxmaj english . i 've come to the last of the four skills , namely writing . i think i 'm fairly good at that . xxmaj it takes a lot of hard work though . xxmaj when i took \" xxmaj business xxmaj english \" last fall we got to do a lot of inquiries , and business - letters which i enjoyed very much . xxmaj at times it is easier to write when you have a given assignment , than to just come up with an idea . xxmaj this forces me to try not to drift away , as i have a tendency to do just that . i 've never had an xxmaj english pen xxunk , so i 've never really written on a regular basis other than when i 've been in school . xxmaj my knowledge of gramatical terms is terrible which might be detected from time to time . xxmaj although i seem to be able to communicate without any larger difficulties . xxmaj in conclusion : xxmaj it seems i 've got my work cut out for me for at least the next two years ahead . xxmaj hopefully i 'll learn to master things and tackle my weak spots quickly . xxmaj after that there are other challenges that need to be attended to . xxfld 2 ﻿ xxmaj in the name of xxmaj religion , you can get away with anything ! xxmaj with this argumentative piece i 've tried to shed a light on the consequences of religion . xxmaj what goes on , apart from all of the good deeds man does in the name of religion . i 've devided them in five headings , all regarding different aspects of the topic . i myself am not a believer . i 'm a naturally born critic or sceptic , if you will . i firmly believe that it should be up to every man / woman to inividually process information and facts that are given or thrown upon us . xxmaj just because something has been going on for a long period of time does n't necessarily mean it 's alright . 1 ) xxmaj religion is prohibiting . xxmaj it compromises the person . xxmaj religion prevents individual thinking and persuades mankind to accept and \" buy the whole concept \" of its ideas in the scriptures . xxmaj the scriptures compromise peoples prerogative to think for themselves , they roothlesly rob people of their natural ability to evaluate and act on their own intuition . xxmaj religion makes the individual fall in line and not to question anything it says . xxmaj is that a good thing , i ask ? xxmaj is compromising yourself necessary , in the name of religion ? 2 ) xxmaj religion causes conflicts . xxmaj lets look at religion in a passed - present - future perspective . i do n't think i 'm going out on a limb if i point out that more or less all wars , some excluded originates from religious grounds and believes . xxmaj the discontent of people who do n't agree with you or do n't share your believes causes conflicts in the name of religion . 3 ) xxmaj religion prevents individual freedom . xxmaj in the end of 1980 , an xxmaj irish - catholic girl was brutaly raped and got pregnant . xxmaj she suffered in agony for she wanted to have the foetus removed but her religion forbids abortion . xxmaj her case was globaly acknowledged in the media and many , myself included felt for her and witnessed the madness , in the name of religion . xxmaj the bible , an ancient book of moral clauses and devises for a pure way of life , said she could n't have an abortion . xxmaj luckely she could get help in xxmaj england and have the abortion done there . xxmaj imagine if she had n't , what life would that child have led ! ? 4 ) xxmaj religion discriminates . xxmaj sure , it unifies certain people who share the same ideology . xxmaj on the other hand it condems different genres even within the same religion and thus the people who do n't agree with them . xxmaj people who do n't share their point of view or religious believes . xxmaj is it righteous to commit cruel actions as long as it is in the name of religion ? 5 ) xxmaj religious downpayment ! ? xxmaj even in the early days you were able to go to your church and seek repentance for your sins . xxmaj you mearly went to a priest and confessed and he would gladly give it to you . xxmaj he might suggest that you ought to do a few xxmaj hail xxmaj mary 's and suddenly in an instance you had been forgiven . xxmaj back then you could even assure your place in heaven when buying a letter of indulgence . xxmaj buy your way into the xxmaj lords glory , heaven , kingdom or what ever you preferred . xxmaj today 's version of that same phenomena is called xxmaj televangelism . xxmaj the 80 's way to repentance . xxmaj televised fundraisings , usually held by a spiritual leader of some kind . xxmaj he would very convincingly encourage the viewers to support his \" cause \" , by donating obnoxiously large sums of money to him and the \" cause \" . xxmaj the cause might be o an honest nature , to build evangelist churches or help the poor . xxmaj but in some cases they were spend for personal gain by the so called prophet . xxmaj outrageous news of spiritual leaders spending their money on prostitutes and extramarital affairs . xxmaj these people who are supposed to set an example to their followers . i guess their only human , but it ca n't feel all that to be good old xxmaj mrs xxmaj lewis in the south of xxmaj california , who recently donated a large sum to \" reverend xxmaj chastity \" , and learn that he has spent \" her \" money on questionable things , can it ! ? xxmaj it 's a strange world we live in where some people profits from other peoples misery . xxmaj conclusion : xxmaj imagine a world without prejudice of religion , race , colour or believes ! xxmaj almost impossible to picture i know . xxmaj religion should be more humble and \" human \" , it should serve as a medium that brings people together , not to discriminate . i 'm not saying that it should be removed or terminated , because many people need to be able to put their trust in a supreme being . xxmaj it needs to be altered / changed or modified , since everything else has been in order to fit in in today 's society . xxmaj many vicious things have been done , is being done and will be done in the name of religion . xxmaj it is not acceptable ! xxup take xxup action !, Text xxbos xxfld 1 xxunk to the increasing violence that we 're daily exposed to , a need to take action has arisen . xxmaj television broadcasters and cable suppliers have been asked to xxunk a computer - chip ( the v - chip ) . xxmaj this chip will enable parents to protect their children from \" the rude xxunk of the xxunk \" ( xxup g. \n",
       " xxmaj the v - chip will read encoded signals from the suppliers and on scale from one to four parents may determine what should be allowed on their television - sets and what should n't . xxmaj gina xxmaj bellafante , writes about the v - chip in xxup time xxmaj magazine , xxmaj july , 24 , 1995 under the topic \" locking out violence \" . xxmaj using the article in question as a xxunk , i have chosen to address the v - chip aspect and to emphasize my very personal views on its purpose and usage . \" xxmaj we 're not suggesting this is a perfect solution . xxmaj all we 're doing is offering something to parents who have to be in the work force \" , says xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj james xxmaj xxunk , in regards to the v - chip . xxmaj first of all i must say that i find it appalling , the way we wrongly use our television - sets as xxunk ! xxmaj in my meaning there are already far too many parents today who more or less park their kids in front of the xxup tv when they do n't know what to do with them , as it is . xxmaj the v - chip may very well succeed in shutting - out violence broad xxunk on xxup tv , but at the end of the day what it all comes down to is parental responsibility . xxmaj that we as parents make sure that our beloved children are n't exposed to violence . a v - chip would of course be very convenient , but is it really necessary ? xxmaj no ! i propose that instead we all should get more involved in our children 's leisure activities , is n't it our responsibility as parents to actually bring up our children and not to just do so at our own convenience , when it xxunk us . xxmaj could it be that we are lead behind the light by \" the marketing - people \" into spending money on something totally unnecessary , such as the v - chip ? xxmaj this remark since by now we humans have learnt to master the skill of coming up with inventions , gadgets and things developed and designed to \" ease \" our lives , to create a need for something that we could more or less be without ! xxmaj who could have predicted for example that the xxunk - phones would become such an important device , fifteen years ago ? a device of such importance that some people hardly can bare to do without nowadays ? xxmaj we humans have become to comfortable , things have to be simplified and xxunk to fit in into our quest for xxunk . xxmaj next comes the question of alternatives , and if there are any ? i say , xxup yes of course there are , how did people manage in the old days when there were no xxmaj tele 's or kindergartens , they brought their kids with them . xxmaj do we actually have to find a xxunk to help us out here ? xxmaj kids should n't be at home watching tele all the time anyway , what ever happened to playing xxunk , spending time with your family and friends or simply talking to one - another ? xxmaj children of today 's materialistic society grow up lacking social skills , which we can easily detect , in say , the way we talk to eachother , the lack of sympathy and respect for other people than yourself . xxmaj now we have to take affirmative action so that we do n't allow our children to grow up as monsters , xxunk and / or lost souls without emotions . xxmaj last but not least there is the aspect of supervising people and xxunk on their right to privacy . i presume that the xxmaj broadcasters wo n't be too happy about the v - xxmaj chip either , since they stand to loose a lot of their viewers . i think that they will strongly and xxunk object to the suggestion in question . i find myself agreeing with xxmaj senator xxmaj robert xxmaj dole on his statement on the v - xxmaj chip . xxmaj he feels that the v - xxmaj chip is yet another step closer to the government getting control on what we see on television . i feel and many with me that it should be up to every person for himself to chose what he or she wants to watch on xxup tv . xxmaj as long as it is not illegal , of course . xxmaj the fact of it is that if we install a v -

to - date statistics and then mention some different varieties of xxmaj english and explain the terms xxmaj pidgins and xxmaj creoles . i find it important to investigate how it is possible for a language spoken by so few at the beginning to become a world language which is quite familiar to so many people . xxmaj my sources are secondary , since it is difficult to find good primary sources on this subject . 2 . xxmaj definition of a world language xxmaj what is a world language ? xxmaj according to the xxmaj swedish xxmaj encyclopaedia xxmaj nationalencyklopedin ( 1996 ) it is a language which is spoken or understood by a considerable number of people around the globe . xxmaj thus languages such as xxmaj chinese ( xxmaj mandarin ) , xxmaj english and xxmaj arabic are world languages , but not xxmaj swedish or artificial languages such as xxmaj esperanto . xxmaj to a large extent the position of a language as a world language depends on the literature ( books , papers and scientific works ) that is written in that language . xxmaj english meets with these criteria and is the dominating world language of today . xxmaj seen from a historical point of view otherlanguages have occupied the position as world languages ; in the 17th and 18th centuries xxmaj french was the dominating language . xxmaj before that xxmaj latin and xxmaj greek dominated in the medieval and ancient xxmaj europe . 3 . xxmaj the spread of xxmaj english xxmaj at the beginning xxmaj english was not a widely spread language . xxmaj in xxmaj shakespeare 's time the number of people speaking xxmaj english was as low as a few millions . xxmaj as the population grew the number of xxmaj english speakers did as well . xxmaj english gradually became the main language of xxmaj wales , xxmaj ireland and the xxmaj scottish xxmaj highlands . xxmaj when the xxmaj english commenced to explore the wide world outside the xxmaj british xxmaj isles the first step on the way to xxmaj english becoming a world language had been taken . xxmaj the xxmaj english began to colonise other continents in the 17th and 18th centuries . xxmaj the xxmaj british settlers spoke xxmaj english , but there were many settlements in the xxmaj new xxmaj world from other nations , and they all spoke their native tongue . xxmaj for a very long time xxmaj english , xxmaj spanish , xxmaj french and xxmaj dutch colonisers fought for the dominance of the xxmaj caribbean and by the early 19th century xxmaj britain had control of a number of the xxmaj west xxmaj indian islands . xxmaj this resulted in xxmaj english becoming the most spoken language of the area . xxmaj the xxmaj english also took control over the xxmaj indian subcontinent and a few years later the xxmaj british colonisation of xxmaj australia took place . xxmaj british rule was established in xxmaj singapore , xxmaj british xxmaj guiana , xxmaj new xxmaj zealand and xxmaj hong xxmaj kong and later on also in parts of xxmaj west xxmaj africa , xxmaj east xxmaj africa and xxmaj southern xxmaj africa ( xxmaj barber 1993:234 - 5 ) . xxmaj the xxmaj english dominance is mainly due to political and economical reasons , e.g. the strength of the xxmaj british xxmaj empire during the 18th and 19th centuries . xxmaj after xxmaj world xxmaj war two the position of the xxup us became increasingly more powerful as regards political , economical , technical , scientific and generally cultural areas . 4 . xxmaj statistics xxmaj english is used in over 70 countries as an official or semi - official language . xxmaj according to xxmaj stora xxmaj focus ( 1987 ) the largest xxmaj english speaking populations are found in the xxup us ( 230 million ) , the xxup uk ( 56 million ) , xxmaj canada ( 17 million ) , xxmaj australia ( 15 million ) , xxmaj new xxmaj zealand ( 3 million ) , xxmaj ireland ( 3 million ) xxmaj south xxmaj africa ( 2 million ) and xxmaj jamaica ( 2 million ) . xxmaj english is the official language in all these countries and has an official status in over 50 more countries with approximately one milliard inhabitants in all . xxmaj the largest of these are xxmaj india , xxmaj pakistan and the xxmaj philippines . xxmaj as a first language xxmaj english is spoken by more than 400 million people all over the world of today . xxmaj another 350 million use it regularly as a second language . a further 100 million speak it more or less fluently as a foreign language and of the estimated 40 million users of the xxmaj internet the majority communicate in xxmaj english . xxmaj since the middle of the 20th century xxmaj english is the language that is most frequently taught at school in most countries all over the world . xxmaj its central position in the international communication is due to the fact that the majority of all scientific publications printed in the world are in xxmaj english . xxmaj for example 2 / 3 of the medical journals published in 1985 were in xxmaj english . xxmaj the main language of books , newspapers , airports and air - traffic control , international business and academic conferences , technology , diplomacy , sport , international competitions , pop music and advertising is xxmaj english . 5 . xxmaj varieties \" xxmaj although xxmaj english has become an international language , it lacks any independent standard codification or description that adequately reflects its international character , \" says xxmaj samuel xxmaj ahulu in his article \" xxmaj general xxmaj english \" ( 1997 ) . xxmaj there are nowadays many varieties of xxmaj english and to discuss them in detail is far too complex to deal with here . xxmaj some of the varieties are ; xxmaj british xxmaj english ( abbreviated xxup rp ; xxmaj received xxmaj pronunciation ) , xxmaj american xxmaj english ( xxup ae ) and xxmaj canadian xxmaj english as well as xxmaj australian , xxmaj new xxmaj zealand , xxmaj south xxmaj african , and xxmaj west xxmaj indian xxmaj english . xxmaj these varieties differ as regards pronunciation , stress , intonation and vocabulary . 6 . xxmaj pidgins and xxmaj creoles xxmaj there are probably well over two hundred xxmaj pidgin- and xxmaj creole - languages in the world today , and they are based on many different languages such as xxmaj french , xxmaj portuguese and xxmaj zulu but the largest number is based on xxmaj english . xxmaj between six and twelve million people are still using xxmaj pidgin languages and between ten and seventeen million are using languages descending from xxmaj pidgins , so called xxmaj creoles . a xxmaj pidgin is an auxiliary language used mainly by people trading with each other when they have no common language . xxmaj the word xxmaj pidgin is thought to be from a xxmaj chinese xxmaj pidgin version of the xxmaj english word business . xxmaj you might say that the xxmaj pidgin is a simplified form of the dominant language . xxmaj the grammatical morphology is simple and the vocabulary is limited . xxmaj maybe the most known xxmaj pidgin is the one of xxmaj papua xxmaj new xxmaj guinea , called xxmaj tok xxmaj pisin , which even is acknowledged in the country 's constitution , although it nowadays more accurately should be described as a xxmaj creole . xxmaj when a xxmaj pidgin develops beyond its role as a trade language and becomes the first language of a social community , it is called a xxmaj creole . xxmaj there is , however , no sharp distinction between a xxmaj pidgin and a xxmaj creole . ( xxmaj yule 1996 , xxmaj barber 1993 ) 7 . xxmaj conclusion xxmaj it is most likely that xxmaj english will continue to keep its position as a world language also in the future . xxmaj no other language shows any signs of threatening xxmaj english as the leading language . xxmaj especially as regards the xxup it - market , which is the most important field of exploration and development in the future , xxmaj english is the dominating language of communication . xxmaj this is due to the fact that the xxup us is the leading state on the market . xxmaj it is extremely advantageous that there is such a language as xxmaj english by which you are able to communicate all over the world . xxmaj english is in truth a world language . xxfld 2 ﻿ xxmaj the xxmaj decline of the xxmaj birth - rate in xxmaj sweden a negative trend that can be observed in the xxmaj swedish society of today is the decline of the birth - rate . xxmaj in 1990 the number of children born in xxmaj sweden was 120 000 , in 1994 it was 110 000 and in 1998 it was as low as 89 000 . xxmaj the number of deceased persons was 95 000 , 92 000 and 93 000 respectively - in other words , there is an excess of deaths over births . xxmaj at the same time the total population of xxmaj sweden increased from 8,6 million people in 1990 to 8,8 million in 1994 and to 8,9 million in 1998 . xxmaj these statistics , which i have obtained from the homepage of the xxup scb , illuminate this trend very clearly . xxmaj but what are the reasons for this phenomenon ? xxmaj the main cause of the low birth - rate is the economic situation . xxmaj it is simply too expensive for many people to bring up children in our society . xxmaj therefore family planning has become usual . xxmaj the possibility to avoid unwanted pregnancies through preventives or the alternative to go through a legal abortion has of course had a very great impact on the birth - rates . xxmaj the child allowance far from cover the loss of income during pregnancy , maternity leave and all other expenses involved when raising a child . xxmaj many couples decide to become parents later in life after having obtained a good job and earned some money and paid off their debts . xxmaj sometimes the decision is made too late and others never reach the point in life when they decide that the time to bring children into the world has come . xxmaj furthermore , women 's position in society has gone through a radical change . xxmaj formerly a woman was expected to give birth to children and take care of the household . xxmaj these were her major tasks in life . xxmaj nowadays women have the opportunity of achieving the same positions in business and professional life as men . xxmaj consequently , this has influenced the female way of life . xxmaj after compulsory school an increasing number of young men and women continue their studies , at university for example . xxmaj the studies often take many years to complete and giving birth to a child during that time is not what most women desire . xxmaj after the studies quite a few women want to make a carrier and when they intend to climb the ladder of success children are not considered convenient . xxmaj thus women neither have the time nor want to raise children . xxmaj it has now become more socially accepted than earlier to have a carrier instead of choosing ordinary family - life if you can not combine them . xxmaj what may the effects of this decline of the birth - rate be ? xxmaj the most terrifying aspect is that it makes the economy of the country weak . xxmaj this may need some further explanation . xxmaj the number of people above the age of 60 was in 1990 18 % of the total population in the xxup oecd - countries ( xxmaj organization for xxmaj economic xxmaj co - operation and xxmaj development ) and statisticians have reached the conclusion that the number will be 30 % in 2030 . xxmaj in other words , the number of retired people will increase and thus the state - budgets will have to be used to take care of old people instead of the younger generation . xxmaj this will lead to reduced contributions as regards education and the consequence will be a deteriorated school - system . xxmaj the result will be a generation of people without sufficient education . xxmaj swedish know - how will decrease and thus weaken the xxmaj swedish economy . xxmaj also other contributions , for instance means for the infrastructure and the military , will diminish and the country will slowly begin to decay . xxmaj nevertheless , the troublesome problem with unemployment will fade away when the workers of today retire and their professional posts must be filled . xxmaj provided that the school - system still is satisfactory the young people will have no difficulty in finding jobs . xxmaj this will , hopefully , lead to a rapid development in society and xxmaj sweden will catch up with what was lost during the time of \" depression \" . xxmaj in the long run this decreasing rate of nativity might be very healthy for the economy of the country , but the change should take place at a slower pace than it does at the moment . xxmaj attempts have been made from the government to encourage people to have more children . xxmaj in conclusion this trend of decline of the birth - rate is due to the difficult economic situation of the last years . xxmaj lately signs indicate that the economic situation is improving and if this is the case , the birth - rate most certainly will improve . xxmaj the fact that women make carriers probably does not influence the birth - rate as much as the economic situation does ., Text xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ xxup part - xxup time xxup fathers xxmaj when a relationship has xxunk broken down and separation is inevitable , the children are more often than not the real losers . xxmaj traditionally the child has always lived with the mother after the break - up of the parents . xxmaj there is new trend emerging in xxmaj sweden , however , part - time fathers are becoming more common , that is , the child lives xxunk with his / her father / mother , for example , every second week . i have isolated three different causes that i think could have caused this . xxmaj firstly , the law reforms that have enabled fathers to play a bigger role in their children 's lives . xxmaj secondly , the fathers seem to be more willing to take on more responsibility in raising their children . xxmaj thirdly , both parents seem to have become aware of the importance of the father 's role in the children 's lives . i have based my essay partly on my own views as well as newspaper articles from xxmaj dagens xxmaj nyheter and the book xxmaj sverige xxmaj en xxmaj xxunk och xxmaj social xxmaj historia . xxmaj in 1960s and 1970s marriage and especially de - facto relationships became more common than ever before . xxmaj during the 1970s law reforms took affect which gave men and women equal opportunity to work and take care of their children . xxmaj sweden was unique in that it enabled fathers to go on xxunk leave , although , not many of the men took the opportunity to stay at home and look after their children ( xxmaj sverige p.159 ) . xxmaj in xxmaj october of 1998 another law reform came into affect which gave the courts the right to grant shared custody and alternate living for the child , even if this went against the will of either partner ( xxunk ) . xxmaj the present day situation have changed , however , and with the 1998 law reform more parents have shared custody than they did before . xxmaj the 1998 law reform has given fathers equal opportunity to actively take part in their children 's every - day lives and they now have equal say in how to raise their children . xxmaj the upbringing of a child was almost an exclusive right that the mothers had before , the father normally only spent time with his child on the week - end . xxmaj this created an unrealistic picture in the child 's mind of what a father should be like , he became someone that you only did fun things with . xxmaj for many fathers being a \" week - end - dad \" is not enough and with the new reform they can now play an equally important role in their children 's lives if they want to . xxmaj another development is that both parents are thinking of what is best for their children . xxmaj there seem to be an increased awareness that a child need both parents for his / her psychological well - being . xxmaj some experts argue , however , that alternate living can be detrimental and that it can cause these children to feel that they do not have a permanent situation in their lives . a solution to this would be that the child has only one home , and the parents would be the ones having to move back and forth . xxmaj according to children living in these situations , constant moving and packing of xxunk seemed to be the most negative aspect with having two homes . xxmaj they said that they otherwise felt satisfied and it had not affected them xxunk ) . xxmaj it seems that the children appear quite content with living xxunk with their parents , and xxunk it does not seem that this type arrangement would be harmful for the children . xxmaj shared custody seems to be a good solution to a difficult situation , it is an advantage if a child maintains a healthy relationship with either parent . xxmaj the negative aspect , however , is as i said before that we all need a stable situation . xxmaj ideally would ( of course ) be if the family was one unit , xxmaj but when this is not possible the model of alternative living seems to be a good solution , and it is apparent that these parents are acting in the best interest of their children . xxfld 2 ﻿ \" xxmaj taboo or xxmaj not xxmaj taboo \" xxmaj in the article \" xxmaj cleaning up the language \" by xxmaj shirley e xxmaj peckham , the author takes a clear stand on children who use swear words in their language . xxmaj she has a very conservative view of language and wants it to be like \" in the good old days \" when she was a child . xxmaj what she does not realise is that language is changing all the time ; if it does not change it is dead . xxmaj the part that seems to disturb her the most is that she becomes \" filled with disgust \" when she hears children use bad language . xxmaj furthermore , she is worried that allowing this kind of words will lead to bad language used by everybody in the future . xxmaj she has strong opinions on the use of language but nevertheless she does not have any suggestions on how this matter should be solved . xxmaj one way for xxmaj peckham to solve this matter and make her feel better would perhaps be to try to talk with the children involved . xxmaj unfortunately , it seems like she is of the opinion that children are as disgusting as swear words so i doubt she will ever confront them . xxmaj my experience though , is that it is often a good idea to talk to children about different problems that occur . xxmaj if you talk to them on an appropriate level and do not patronize them you have at least a possibility to change a negative pattern . xxmaj to use the method that xxmaj peckham is suggesting as solution , namely to box a child around his or her ears , is what i would call disgusting . xxmaj peckham has been raised in this manner and perhaps it is the only way she knows to demand respect and to make someone listen to her . xxmaj but to my mind abusing a child by threatening or hitting him or her is not a very constructive or educational way of learning . i do believe that children learn better if they are secure and not scared of the people around them . xxmaj in her article xxmaj peckham also refers to this language as \" foul anti - social \" . i would say that she has misinterpreted the situation completely . xxmaj on the contrary , the language between children in a group is definitely a very social phenomenon . xxmaj by using a certain kind of language it is possible for them to identify themselves with the rest of the group and this is of great importance while growing up . xxmaj in addition i am convinced that most children have the judgement not to use bad language when it is not suitable , for example when they talk to older relatives . xxmaj in contrast to xxmaj peckham , i do believe in children 's ability to adjust to different situations . xxmaj this above - mentioned ability is also the answer to the author 's fear of swear words becoming general practice in the future . xxmaj perhaps is it also a question of maturity . xxmaj this kind of words may be common in children 's language but when they grow up these words usually reduce in number or at least they are not used in public so frequently . xxmaj even xxmaj mrs xxmaj peckham admits that she swore when she was a child , even if she does it reluctantly . xxmaj for her it seems to be a question about swear words being taboo or not taboo and maybe the reason to this is the way she was treated as a child when she swore . xxmaj to sum up i would like to say that it is not so difficult for me to accept children that swear or the words in themselves . xxmaj but to xxmaj mrs xxmaj peckham and the likes of her i can not emphasise enough the importance of verbal communication to solve a matter instead of using violence . xxmaj communication will lead to children feeling safe and is not that what we all want ?]...\n",

the television is an amazing invention and has a lot of good qualities , but where there is good there is evil . xxmaj ten years ago watching television was quite harmless , although violence existed it was not as raw as it is today . xxmaj basically every action - film today contains very much unrealistic violence . xxmaj even the cartoons has a lot of violent elements and what kind of effect does that have on the young viewers ? xxmaj it is no secret that television has a strong impact on its viewers . xxmaj especially children , as they do not always realise what is real and what is fiction . xxmaj to trick a child is not difficult and that is one of the reasons why children - commercials are forbidden in many countries . xxmaj but what is scary is that there is very little restriction towards violent xxmaj tv - shows . xxmaj although there are age - limits and recommended parental xxunk , children have very little trouble to xxunk these restrictions . xxmaj there is an ongoing debate about how to solve this xxmaj tv - violence but very little is actually done . xxmaj adults still want to be able to look at these kinds of films so to ban all xxunk movies would be impossible . xxmaj there is no easy solution to this problem but in the end parents are utmost responsible to protect their children . xxmaj first , i believe we can all agree that violence on xxmaj tv have increased a lot . xxmaj it has become a new kind of entertainment . xxmaj adults find violence entertaining and the film and movie makers respond by adding more and rawer violence and special effects . xxmaj adults can see the difference between real life and fiction . xxmaj but children lack in experience and are often xxunk see the difference . xxmaj so xxmaj tv becomes reality and this can be observed by watching xxunk . xxmaj it is no longer innocent games , it can clearly be seen that television has had impact on them and children express feelings while playing . xxmaj today boys play \" action - man \" and girls play \" model \" , nobody is interested in playing \" house \" anymore . xxmaj television reflects society and violence have increased not only on xxmaj tv but also in real life . xxmaj one can wonder why is that so ? xxmaj are people more evil today then ten years ago ? xxmaj how big part does television actually play ? xxmaj this issue raises more questions than answers but it is an important subject and it must be discussed , as we xxunk it to the children . xxmaj one thing that could be done to protect the children is to broadcast violent films at a late hour , rather than displaying it during daytime . xxmaj here the responsibility lie on broadcasting companies however , parents must also take responsibility and really see to it that their children do not stay up late . xxmaj secondly , what kind of effect does too much television - violence have on children and young adults ? xxmaj in society today there has been a huge increasing rate of violent related crimes . xxmaj but what is new about these crimes are that the xxunk and thieves are teenagers . xxmaj what can be said about these teenagers are that they have got a twisted picture about society and reality . xxmaj they take role models from films and these men and woman from \" xxmaj hollywood \" have very little to do with reality . xxmaj what can be said about these role models is that they are \" xxunk \" and can do anything they want . xxmaj when teenagers xxunk these models the outcome is often wrong . xxmaj it is not right to hurt people physically and you can not drive a car threw a xxunk and get away with it . xxmaj still , one must say that television is a good thing after all . xxmaj television is educating and one can get news and information from all over the world . xxmaj however , there are still many things to improve . xxmaj it is not necessary with all this violence but there is no easy solution to this problem . xxmaj but first we must realise that it really is a problem and that it can not be ignored . xxmaj because what will happen to the youths if they continue to consume five hours of violence every day ? xxmaj they will become people without respect and with a twisted picture of life . xxmaj we must do something about this now before it is to late . xxfld 2 xxup ﻿i have now studied xxmaj english for nine years in school and am now capable of evaluating my knowledge in this interesting language . xxmaj my xxmaj english skills have been affected and somewhat improved by the fact that i attended the xxmaj english xxmaj class in the xxmaj swedish gymnasium , and i have also taken the xxmaj cambridge xxmaj certificate in xxmaj advanced xxmaj english . i will now mention some of the strengths and weaknesses i consider i have in the language . xxmaj it took a while before i decided whether i should speak with a xxmaj british or an xxmaj american accent . i believe that i can speak both fairly well , although there was a period of time when i mixed the two . i finally decided on the xxmaj american accent , mainly because i spoke a lot of xxmaj english with my xxmaj canadian cousin during her one year long visit in xxmaj sweden . xxmaj it also feels more relaxed and natural for me , than the xxmaj british accent which sometimes feels a bit too formal . xxmaj in my opinion i sound a bit affected when i try to speak xxmaj british . xxmaj some words are slightly more tricky to pronounce in xxmaj american than in xxmaj british xxmaj english , though , for instance the way you pronounce the \" r \" sounds . xxmaj it is especially difficult when the \" r \" appears in the middle of a word , in that case it is easy to put too much emphasis on it which makes it difficult to continue saying the word in a natural way . xxmaj fortunately this problem is diminishing the more i speak . xxmaj when it comes to reading i have become a lot better at xxunk and xxunk xxmaj english texts during the past few years . i can find the important things i 'm looking for faster , and can easier get an overview of what a text is about . i find it amusing to read passages of books out loud for myself , especially poems and paragraphs worth considering . xxmaj this is also a good way of practicing my speech . xxmaj unfortunately i 'm a bit lazy when i come across words i do n't recognize . xxmaj instead of looking them up in a dictionary i tend to try and figure out what the word means by its context . xxmaj this is not a good way if i want to improve my vocabulary , but i do try to get better and recently i have started to look most of the words up . xxmaj when i listen to other people speaking xxmaj english i rarely have a hard time to follow . xxmaj listening to other people speaking and understanding what they are saying is usually the easiest part when you are learning a new language . i can also understand different accents of xxmaj english to a rather large extent . xxmaj when i do listening comprehension i can easily make significant notes while still listening , but it happens that i lose my concentration and my mind starts to xxunk . i have always found it pretty easy to write both in xxmaj english and xxmaj swedish . xxmaj it usually xxunk well as i write , although it might not always be perfectly accurate . i write the assignment or essay relatively fast , but then i like having time to read it through a number of times , preferably during a period of time xxunk over a couple of days . xxmaj in that way i can make corrections and maybe find alternative words in some of the sentences , which is easier to do the more times you have read it through . i seldom make large spelling errors when writing by hand , i usually see if a word is spelt correctly . xxmaj the structure in my texts are not always satisfactory , but i am trying to work on that . xxmaj it improved some as i took the xxmaj cambridge course , but it can always become better . i 'm not totally familiar with punctuation when writing in xxmaj english , it 's sometimes difficult to know when to put the xxunk in . xxmaj the thing i know the least about when it comes to xxmaj english is grammar . xxmaj throughout my school years i have always been among the lucky ones who usually can hear if a sentence sounds correct or not and have therefore never bothered to learn the different rules . i now regret my lack of attention in that area , and i have to put in some extra effort to learn it now instead ., Text xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ \t xxmaj today there is nothing strange or odd about being vegetarian , on the contrary , it shows that you have some moral and ethical values or a philosophical ideology that you live up to , xxunk has become a trend in the western society . i will refer to the trend as xxunk even though we should be aware of the different directions , for instance there are those who eat milk and egg products , those who do not eat meat but they eat fish and those who do not eat anything that comes from the animal world . xxmaj if you were a vegetarian fifteen years ago you were the strange one . xxmaj today every xxunk restaurant has at least one vegetarian dish on their xxunk , even xxmaj mc xxmaj xxunk have vegetarian alternatives to their xxunk . xxmaj fifteen years ago the xxmaj indian restaurants were the only place you could go to if you wanted to order something more than a xxunk xxunk . xxmaj you also had to do some research about nutrition to be sure that you got everything your body needed , today you can buy frozen vegetarian ready - xxunk food with all the different substances your body requires and the different alternatives are almost as many as the non vegetarian alternatives . xxmaj the reasons why you become vegetarian are more or less the same now as then , some examples are : reaction against how the animals are treated , ideological believes and health problems . xxmaj the question is why ? xxmaj what is it that has changed during this last 15 years ? i have found three different reasons that together have contributed to cause the trend . xxmaj this process was started some fifteen years ago , when we all learned how chickens were treated . xxmaj media realised the potential of the issue and have informed us since about many of the horrible situations that animals are subjected to before slaughter . xxmaj this is one of the reasons why many became vegetarians , but it also caused the market forces to react and it was suddenly alright to pay more for animals living in relative good circumstances . xxmaj still , we have been reached by several alarming reports these last years and they have shown that it can be dangerous to eat meat due to the different products that animals are filled up with , some of them in order to prevent xxunk and diseases , other to lower the production costs . xxmaj some examples of this are for instance the xxunk stuffed xxunk , the xxunk treated pigs and the crazy cows . xxmaj another reason is the modern society we live in , today we can import and eat any fruit or vegetable at any time of the year thanks to the modern communication which makes us less dependent on meat . xxmaj at the beginning it was very expensive to live on vegetables and only the rich and educated could afford it . xxmaj xxunk became a hip and healthy lifestyle and the most distinguished xxunk were challenged by the novelty of this area which made xxunk to something exclusive . xxmaj the xxunk and xxunk disappeared when the average consumer claimed his right to this lifestyle and the market had to adjust itself to the demand and supply . xxmaj to be a vegetarian today is not necessarily associated to a certain class , it is a general awareness of our bodies and our health and many eating disorders are symptoms of this physical awareness . xxmaj lastly we have the environmental awareness . xxmaj the high production of meat has caused an over - production of xxunk manure , which combined with air and water becomes the acid xxunk that xxunk our environment . xxmaj today 's generation is well aware of the environmental situation that they have inherited and by consuming less meat the production must eventually decrease . xxmaj forests have been cut down in order to create more xxunk land so if this generation had not reacted it might have been too late for the next generation . xxmaj as we can see the consumers are the ones who can make the market change and the market makes consumers change . xxmaj those who reacted against the poor circumstances animals lived in some fifteen or twenty years ago xxunk way for today 's xxunk by forcing the market to offer something better that gave us a clean consciousness . xxmaj this is what i see as the great cause to this trend . xxmaj the market has had to adjust itself to the consumers at the same time as they have managed to create a whole new vegetarian food market , today it is profitable to sell less meat and more vegetarian alternatives . xxmaj we want to feel good about ourselves and the market wants to make money . xxmaj today it is easy to live well and feel good about yourself and that is why the xxunk has become a trend in our societies , we can eat vegetarian xxunk , xxunk and xxunk that taste as the xxunk so we do not have to feel as if we xxunk anything at the time as the market is making its money . xxmaj but there are also those who see xxunk as a part of xxmaj darwin 's evolution of species and if that is the case perhaps this is not only a trend . xxfld 2 ﻿ xxmaj the number of xxunk phones in xxmaj sweden still increases xxmaj everywhere you go you see people talking in xxunk phones . xxmaj in xxmaj sweden today , the xxunk phone has become even more common than the ordinary xxunk telephone ; in the autumn of 1999 , xxunk to numbers then presented by the xxmaj swedish government , nearly 5 million xxmaj swedes - about 55 per cent of the xxmaj swedish population - owned at least one xxunk phone each . xxmaj this means that the number of xxunk phones has gone from practically zero to five million in only ten years . xxmaj and maybe even more extraordinary is the fact that the number just keeps increasing . xxmaj what could be the reason for this continuing boom ? xxmaj without doubt one reason is that many people want to be xxunk as often as possible . xxmaj for instance they may have jobs where it 's absolutely essential that they are xxunk at any time of the day . xxmaj the xxunk phone becomes an important part of their jobs and they would n't make it without it . xxmaj and i 'm certain that one reason why so many teenage girls and boys are equipped with xxunk phones is that parents want to be able to reach their children as soon as the slightest trace of worry emerges in their easily worried parental minds . xxmaj they do n't mind paying for a phone , but see it as some kind of insurance . xxmaj furthermore , this habit of being xxunk is xxunk - once you 've tried it , it 's hard to stop . xxmaj once you 've bought your first xxunk phone , you may be hooked . xxmaj on the other hand , a great deal of people do n't like to be xxunk all the time , and they are less likely to buy xxunk phones . xxmaj so the xxunk part ca n't be the only reason for the huge number of xxunk sold in xxmaj sweden . xxmaj another reason could be - fashion . xxmaj the xxunk phone has become more than just a phone . xxmaj today the little piece of electronic parts comes in various shapes and colors , equipped with many other functions than those of an ordinary telephone . xxmaj to many people being the owner of the newest , \" hottest \" xxunk phone is just as important as having xxunk fashionable clothes . xxmaj when a model gets too old , it 's a must to replace it with a xxunk one . xxmaj there 's no doubt that the manufacturers of xxunk phones have succeeded in their advertising and marketing - when a new model is about to be released onto the market , the excitement of the public can almost be compared to that of people at some car fair when xxmaj xxunk is about to present a new family car . xxmaj but then again , there of course is a great number of people who do n't care about being in fashion . xxmaj so why do these people also purchase xxunk phones ? a rather important reason , naturally , is the price . xxmaj ten , or even five years ago , a xxunk phone was much more expensive than it is today . xxmaj at the beginning of the xxunk the xxunk phone was considered an article of luxury , owned by very important and / or very rich people only . xxmaj today , this is not the case at all and the prices continue to fall , allowing more and more people to buy xxunk phones of their own . xxmaj however , the phones may be cheaper , but the bills can become rather unpleasant if you use the phone frequently . xxmaj and suppose xxunk were as cheap as xxunk phones - would that mean that everybody would buy a xxunk ? xxmaj that does n't sound very probable . xxmaj so even if the price is right , there must be another , more important reason for all this phone - buying . xxmaj since the beginning of time , man has strived for communication with other people - not only for business but also for pleasure and leisure . xxmaj the means have varied a lot - smoke signals were used by the indians , cave paintings even earlier and the xxmaj xxunk code only recently surrendered to more modern means of communication , just to mention a few . xxmaj and communication is still the thing that keeps everything going in our society . xxmaj consequently , the most important reason for the still increasing number of xxunk phones in xxmaj sweden is the people 's will to communicate - especially since it 's possible to do it at a reasonable cost and with an easy - to - use portable device . xxmaj quite simply - people want and need to talk to each other , and if the preferred \" face - to - face \" mode is n't available , there is always the possibility of using a xxunk phone . xxmaj about ten years ago many people thought that the xxunk phone was just a xxunk . xxmaj they turned out to be wrong . xxmaj and the manufacturers of xxunk phones are still optimistic . xxmaj they xxunk an increase of their products in people 's homes and pockets . xxmaj and as long as xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk keep coming up with new functions in their portable xxunk their xxunk probably will come true . xxmaj because people will keep communicating - be that by speech , text or pictures ., Text xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ xxmaj this is an argumentative essay against xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson 's debate xxunk where he asserts that the xxmaj monarch and the xxmaj royal family should be xxunk by the committee on the constitution of the xxmaj swedish xxmaj riksdag . xxmaj johansson presents three main arguments ; xxmaj his most important argument is that the constitutional xxmaj xxunk agreement from xxunk xxunk that the xxmaj monarch 's duties should be strictly xxunk and representative but there is no control whether the xxmaj monarch , with family , act xxunk or not . xxmaj they should be xxunk just as the xxmaj government or the xxmaj bank of xxmaj sweden . xxmaj another argument is that the xxmaj swedish people have chosen the xxmaj monarchs as their international representatives , but they can not really represent a whole country if they take sides in controversial issues . xxmaj lastly , xxmaj johansson argues that xxmaj sweden 's international reputation is harmed by their statements . xxmaj as i see it this is certainly not a matter for the committee on the constitution as there are other more important issues to xxunk . xxmaj in xxmaj sweden the xxmaj monarch 's role is merely representative according to the constitutional agree from xxunk ; xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk agreement . xxmaj the xxmaj monarchy should not play a political role or make important decisions . xxmaj but we should also keep in mind that half the world is ruled by xxmaj monarchies or xxmaj xxunk and to communicate with those countries the xxmaj monarch is the only alternative . xxmaj to send the minister xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk for instance , that is ' only ' a minister and besides a woman can result as offensive and provoking to some of these countries . xxmaj many xxmaj xxunk countries do only have a ' king - to - king ' communication and in such cases the xxmaj monarch has far greater influence than the constitution would like to recognise . xxmaj neither can i agree with his last argument as i do not believe that their statements can hurt our international reputation more than we already do ourselves by our behaviour at the holiday xxunk . xxmaj johansson has used xxmaj queen xxmaj xxunk as an example . xxmaj she stated in an interview that she was surprised that the xxmaj xxunk sent out their children to throw stones at the xxmaj israeli police . xxmaj this arose a great attention in the xxmaj arab world . xxmaj the xxmaj queen works actively for children 's rights , she has initiated a xxmaj childhood xxmaj foundation ; xxmaj she supports organisations that work for the improvement of children 's rights all over the world and is an xxmaj xxunk member of \" xxmaj xxunk \" and other similar xxunk . xxmaj but the xxmaj queen also represents the xxmaj swedes , and in xxmaj sweden we would never allow our children to risk their lives . i believe it is the xxmaj queen 's obligation to react against all sort of child abuse , as for instance the xxmaj xxunk children 's involvement in the conflict . xxmaj as long as there is not a serious divergence from the xxmaj swedish public opinion they should have the right to react against and comment on public matters . xxmaj the xxmaj king 's statement that the mad cow debate was exaggerated falls on its own absurdity , but still i do not believe that his statement xxunk our reputation or that it should influence politically . xxmaj if anything , he has made a fool of himself . xxmaj the committee on the constitution should xxunk the public sector , they should do something about the political contempt and strengthen the democracy instead of wasting their time on the xxmaj monarchs ' xxunk . xxmaj it is far more important to examine what the politicians do with our tax money , if they really use them to improve our society or if they put it in their own pockets . xxmaj it is also important to check those big international affairs as for instance the xxmaj south xxmaj african xxunk . xxmaj the committee on the constitution should make sure that the governing and decision - making institutions follow the constitution . xxmaj there is no reason to spend time and money xxunk the xxmaj monarchs since they do not possess any power . xxmaj the arguments xxmaj johansson has presented are neither important nor relevant enough to become a task for the committee on the constitution . xxmaj as long as the xxmaj monarchs do not do anything that differs from the xxmaj swedish people 's will there is no reason why the xxmaj monarchs should be xxunk . xxmaj sweden is a small nation and there are very few opportunities for the xxmaj swedish people to express their attitude and therefore the xxmaj monarchs should be able to voice it for us as our representatives . xxmaj if the committee on the constitution is to xxunk the xxmaj monarchs there should be an xxunk to the constitution where the role of the xxmaj monarchs is clearly established . 1

xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ xxmaj the expansion of xxunk in xxmaj uppland \t i first came into contact with xxunk when i , at the age of 10 , together with five older friends was asked to join a team . xxmaj we practiced once a week in a gym using shoes as xxunk . xxmaj we played a couple of xxunk in small halls using even smaller goals without xxunk and only three players from each team were allowed to play at the same time . xxmaj we stopped playing after a couple of months . xxmaj now , fourteen years later , i 've played for seven years and the game is quite different from that of 1987 . xxmaj xxunk are nowadays played with five xxunk players and a xxunk for each team . a board surrounds the field and the sticks weigh 130 xxunk compared to 350 xxunk in the old days . xxmaj in xxmaj uppsala we have one of the biggest xxunk halls in xxmaj sweden with three fields in the same building . xxmaj the number of xxunk players in xxmaj uppland has risen from about 120 in 1987 to 2 xxunk in 1992 and 6 xxunk in 2000 . xxmaj one of the major factors is that the number of players that are younger than sixteen has risen from xxunk ( 27 % of total ) in 1992 to 4 192 ( xxunk % of total ) in 2000 . xxmaj how come a sport like xxunk has grown this quickly ? i remember what it was like when i started to play . xxmaj we all wanted to imitate our idols and when you played xxunk it was of course the hockey stars that we wanted to copy . xxmaj players like xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj kent xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk were hot items . xxmaj now , when the sport has grown , you can hear the young players saying that they are xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , two of xxmaj sweden 's best players , both born in xxmaj uppsala . xxmaj when xxunk was introduced it looked like a nice and calm way to play ice hockey . xxmaj there is not that much close contact as in hockey where you learn how to tackle others . xxmaj in xxunk there only minor xxunk are used and this fact probably makes parents of ten years olds less worried when they see their sons and daughters play . xxmaj is it likely that money is of importance to this increase ? xxmaj xxunk is a rather cheap sport to exercise . a stick does n't have to cost more than 200 xxup sek and most of us already own a pair of training shoes . xxmaj this is pretty much what you need if you are going to play . xxmaj if you compare to tennis a xxunk costs almost 800 xxup sek for an eleven - year - old . xxmaj to spend that amount you have to buy one the most expensive sticks you can find . a membership in a club does not have to be that terrible either even though it can differ a great deal between different clubs . xxmaj usually 200 xxup sek for one year is enough , while in tennis you have to pay 1 000 xxup sek for half a year . xxmaj parents , though , do not care that much if it is really expensive , they want their kids to have fun and to meet friends . xxmaj the kids also do not really care if their stick costs 150 xxup sek or 400 xxup sek , as long as they can play with it . xxmaj the best thing , by far , about xxunk , as a youth sport , is that it is a team sport . xxmaj as in every team sport the team spirit is important . xxmaj in what way , then , does xxunk differ from other team sports ? xxmaj it 's simple . xxmaj the fact is that everyone is allowed to play in the xxunk and have fun . xxmaj there is no talk of using the best player twice as much as the rest of the team ; instead everyone plays almost equally much even if this might cause a loss to the team . xxmaj this is if not unique at least a rather unusual way of dealing with team sports . xxmaj in the sports where there is a chance of a player getting professional status , players can be sorted out as early as when they are seven years old . xxmaj in xxunk there is no rejection or segregation of players at a young age instead everyone is allowed to participate as much as they can . xxmaj if i were a parent i would be really happy to see my kid play in the match even though he or she may not contribute that much to the outcome . xxmaj at least they are enjoying themselves and that is what really matters . i think that the number of people playing xxunk will continue to rise , but probably not as rapidly . xxmaj one thing that you can notice regarding the number of players is that if the total is increased by 300 the youth would rise by 250 . xxmaj this is very encouraging for the future and as long as xxunk continues to be generous to its youngsters it will attract new members . xxfld 2 ﻿ \" xxmaj the rise and the fall of the xxmaj swedish school system \" xxmaj at the beginning of the twentieth century xxmaj sweden was a country where both teachers and students were highly respected . xxmaj it was also a country where many poor parents shared a dream , namely to be able to send at least one of their children to school . xxmaj these parents and children knew that a good education was of great importance since it gave every child , whether he or she was rich or poor , the same opportunities to get a well paid job . xxmaj they also knew how to appreciate a good teacher , since he or she would be the one to lead their children into a brighter future . xxmaj unfortunately this beautiful picture has changed . xxmaj today , when our century is approaching its end , people no longer regard nine years of compulsory school as something important nor something to be proud of . xxmaj these nine years are rather seen as a boring episode which leads either to an xxunk job or another dull three years at upper secondary school . xxmaj nevertheless , many seven - year - olds still have great expectations before beginning first grade . xxmaj sadly enough they soon find out that school is far from what they expected it to be . xxmaj the image of a well - organised classroom with a smiling and helpful teacher who has time for every single student simply no longer exists . xxmaj what a student , in xxmaj sweden in 1999 , can expect is a classroom with too many pupils , old schoolbooks , an xxunk and overworked teacher and an attitude towards school as something boring and useless . xxmaj but it is not only the attitude towards school that has changed , but also the attitude towards teachers . xxmaj instead of mentors who xxunk the future of their students , teachers are rather seen as a xxunk who xxunk about homework . xxmaj so , what has gone wrong ; why does nobody no longer seem to respect or enjoy school ? xxmaj in an open letter to one of xxmaj sweden 's largest newspapers the xxmaj swedish xxmaj liberal xxmaj party , xxmaj folkpartiet , blames the governing parties . xxmaj according to xxmaj folkpartiet one of the major reasons for this change of attitude is that politicians have tried to create a school were all children are at the same level . xxmaj they have tried to create a school where all students are given the exact same opportunities and where no student should feel that he or she is not as bright as his or her fellow students are . xxmaj although this certainly sounds like a very beautiful idea it has , however , not quite worked out the way that the politicians had planned it . xxmaj in their striving to create the perfect school , they have failed xxunk . xxmaj what has happened is that students who work faster than their xxunk have not been given any extra material to work on and have therefore not been given the opportunity to develop . xxmaj some schools have stopped giving out homework since it has been considered unequal and unfair . xxmaj this due to the fact that some students receive more help from their parents when doing their homework , while others more or less have had to manage on their own . xxmaj and perhaps worst of all ; the students who need extra help have not been given it since there is a lack of financial resources and teachers . xxmaj school is no longer considered a place where you learn things , but a place were you either struggle to keep up with your xxunk or just sit and wait , since you do not have anything else to do . xxmaj so , what the politicians really have accomplished to create is : a country in which twenty per cent of the sixteen - year - olds can not read or write properly when they finish ninth grade ; a country which has fewer school days and much less homework than any other xxmaj european country ; and a country where students and teachers seem to have lost respect for one another . xxmaj these are only some of the reasons why people tend to smile when i tell them that i am a student at teacher 's college . xxmaj they simply can not understand why i voluntarily have chosen an xxunk job among people who neither respect me as a person or my occupation , but rather see me as a xxunk . xxmaj this is however not the way i see it . xxmaj what xxmaj sweden needs is a school system which sees every student as an individual and therefore gives these pupils guidance to develop in whatever field they are interested in . xxmaj and if i can work in such a school and can be of any help , then being a teacher will always be my first choice of occupation ., Text xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ xxmaj let the xxmaj royal family speak organ xxmaj johansson argues , in an article from xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj march 3rd 2001 , that the xxmaj king , and all the members of the xxmaj royal family , should be more or less controlled in what the say to avoid awkward and difficult situations for the xxmaj swedish politicians . xxmaj he bases this on the agreement in xxmaj xxunk xxunk , where it was decided that xxmaj sweden were to remain a xxmaj monarchy but the xxmaj king , or xxmaj queen , were to have no political power and only serve as ceremonial persons . a good agreement , according to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson , since the xxmaj swedish people may want the xxmaj king , but practically no one want him to rule the country . i agree that the xxmaj king should not have any political power , but i do not think it is right to try to limit his statements in political issues even though the xxmaj royal family is an exceptional stepping - xxunk for those who want to turn a debate in some direction . i believe that members of the xxmaj royal family should be able to say anything they want and according to the right of free speech , they can . r xxmaj johansson also uses history to give strength to his proposal . xxmaj he tells us how parliamentary government were introduced in xxmaj sweden and how it was put to a difficult test in 1914 when xxmaj king xxmaj gustav v held his xxunk speech attacking the government which ended with the resignation of xxmaj prime xxmaj minister xxmaj karl xxmaj xxunk . i get the feeling that xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson is afraid that something like that could happen . xxmaj however i can not even imagine xxmaj king xxmaj carl xxup xvi xxmaj xxunk making a speech attacking xxmaj goran xxmaj persson and if it would happen , it is not likely that xxmaj goran xxmaj persson would have to resign . xxmaj you could xxunk say that times have changed and i do not think xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson has to be afraid of the xxmaj king making xxmaj goran xxmaj persson resign . xxmaj xxunk by xxmaj king xxmaj carl xxup xvi xxmaj xxunk 's statement that the debate about the mad - cow disease was exaggerated , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson throws out a question whether it is possible to keep the xxmaj king as a trustworthy symbol for our country if it is obvious that he has chosen a side in a highly controversial matter . i do not see why the xxmaj king 's credibility as a symbol for xxmaj sweden would suffer only because he lets the xxmaj swedish people know what he thinks in a discussed topic . xxmaj should not he , the xxmaj king of xxmaj sweden , be allowed to tell what he believes ? organ xxmaj johansson also reflects over the year 2000 where there were almost only good things said about xxmaj sweden in other countries . xxmaj you could read about the xxmaj holocaust conference and the opening of the xxunk over xxunk . xxmaj one of the negative news was , according to xxmaj johansson , created by xxmaj queen xxmaj xxunk when she , in an interview last xxmaj october , said that she could not understand why xxmaj xxunk sent their children out in the streets to throw xxunk towards the xxmaj israeli police . xxmaj johansson says that the xxmaj queen 's view of the conflict in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east is completely off target and i do not know enough about the conflict to argue with him , but he also says that it was evident that the xxmaj queen had picked a side . xxmaj for me it is not that clear , but what i know of the xxmaj queen 's xxunk is that she is always looking after the children in every situation . xxmaj if she did take the children 's side in that discussion i would not object at all , even though it got big attention in the xxmaj arab world . xxmaj it was , however , unfortunate that there were peace talks between xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk at that time and that xxmaj sweden was leading the discussions . i still believe in the right of free speech , even for the xxmaj royal family , why should they be an exception ? i can very well agree that both the xxmaj king and xxmaj queen may not always make very clever statements , but it is their right to make statements , clever or not , as any other person . xxmaj if they were not allowed to say anything they wanted it would probably limit their xxunk in different areas . xxmaj imagine the following scenario ; a reporter comes up to the xxmaj king and asks what he thinks of the current unemployment rate in xxmaj sweden . xxmaj the xxmaj king , xxunk to keep neutral in political questions , answers \" xxmaj no comment \" or \" i do not know \" when he instead would like to have said something like \" i think that the government has to do something to lower the unemployment rate \" . a lot of strange situations could arise if the xxmaj royal family was not allowed to comment on political questions . xxmaj all i can say to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson is : xxmaj let the xxmaj royal family speak . xxmaj in an article from xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj march 3rd 2001 xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson , a social democratic member of the xxmaj riksdag , argues that the standing committee of the constitution should have power to examine how the head of xxmaj state is handling his duties . xxmaj he demonstrates this by showing different examples of members of the xxmaj royal family making , according to xxmaj mr xxmaj johansson , inappropriate comments in the political world . xxmaj he also backs up his arguments by describing the long and slow process , in which the xxmaj king 's role was reduced to a ceremonial and representative one , towards democracy in xxmaj sweden and implies that we can not let the xxmaj royal family gain any sort of political power . xxfld 2 ﻿ \" xxmaj the rise and the fall of the xxmaj swedish school system \" xxmaj at the beginning of the twentieth century xxmaj sweden was a

       "[Text xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ xxmaj english , my xxmaj english ! xxmaj xxunk ones strengths and weaknesses in any situation is a hard task . xxmaj usually we are not so good at xxunk our strengths , instead we spend our time being critical of ourselves , thus we tend to present a much more detailed side of our flaws . i will try to give you a reasonable picture of my good and not quite as good sides , as i see them , in reference to the four skills that were mentioned in the guide - lines handed out earlier in regard of this essay . y biggest weakness by far is reading in xxmaj english . i most of the time find it quite boring , it probably has to do with the fact that i 'm a very outgoing person and therefore i like meeting people and i prefer to converse with them . a contributing factor to my feelings about reading also has to do with the fact that i 'm just not used to it , which makes reading a bit uncomfortable . xxmaj it takes time to read and it is not by far as fun as actually talking with someone . xxmaj you miss out on facial expressions and the dialogue for example . xxmaj it 's not that i ca n't manage , i just do n't find it all that amusing , at times . xxmaj this leads too the fact that i more or less skim through anything written in xxmaj english , which ultimately results in my xxunk . xxmaj but i am indeed working on that partly since it is required in order to be able to teach but also for my own benefit . i have been known to read books in xxmaj english on occasion though . xxmaj preferably novels taking place during the nineteenth century when in my personal opinion the xxmaj english language was at its best . i think it 's terrible that we 've lost so much of the chivalry , the sence of class and style that one can encounter in for example xxmaj jane xxmaj xxunk ' \" xxmaj pride & xxmaj prejudice \" , or the vocabulary used in xxmaj xxunk works . xxmaj this brings us to the speaking , which i believe is one of my strongest features , not only when it comes to speaking xxmaj english , but speaking in general . i admit that it sometimes does get out of hand . xxmaj you see , in my previous xxmaj english classes i 've always been the one to speak my opinion and discuss things that are important to me . xxmaj this might and actually has lead to the fact that others who are not as forward as i am just sit quiet and on top of that they 're doing absolutely nothing to change or take any kind of initiative to speak . xxmaj this xxunk me , should i keep holding back to suit them or should i allow myself the xxunk to improve and broaden my horizons ! ? xxmaj in this class though it does n't seem to be a thing that even needs to be discussed , since everybody is fairly good in xxmaj english , and not at all shy . i do know how and when to use a very formal vocabulary , but i tend to disregard that at times when i get \" too comfortable \" with the person i 'm addressing , it 's not a lack of respect or anything of that nature , i just get too \" buddy - xxunk \" . i think that speaking a lot helps me improve all the aspects of xxmaj english , writing , reading , listening but most importantly to communicate in any given situation . xxmaj my desire to communicate enables people in my everyday life to correct me when i 'm wrong and vice versa . i believe there are two kinds of xxmaj english students . xxmaj the ones that learn the language by using grammar and dictionaries and school - xxmaj english , not that there is anything wrong with that . xxmaj in fact i think it 's a good start , a solid base to begin at . xxmaj and then the others , much like myself , who learn by actually speaking , conversing and therefore picking up a rich vocabulary . xxmaj both have advantages and disadvantages . i 've learned my xxmaj english by speaking , practising and perhaps xxunk by listening to others . xxmaj listening is also one of my strengths . xxmaj for this is where i learn and adapt . i like watching news , documentaries or whatever is on in xxmaj english . xxmaj if i 'm lucky i might even catch one of xxmaj david xxmaj xxunk ' \" wild - life - documentaries \" . xxmaj he has an elegant vocabulary and intonation . xxmaj although i must say that if it were possible to choose i 'd pick one of the people behind the series of \" xxmaj the young ones \" , preferably xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj but i 'm not xxunk to listening to sports either , as long as it is xxmaj english . i 've come to the last of the four skills , namely writing . i think i 'm fairly good at that . xxmaj it takes a lot of hard work though . xxmaj when i took \" xxmaj business xxmaj english \" last fall we got to do a lot of inquiries , and business - letters which i enjoyed very much . xxmaj at times it is easier to write when you have a given assignment , than to just come up with an idea . xxmaj this forces me to try not to drift away , as i have a tendency to do just that . i 've never had an xxmaj english pen xxunk , so i 've never really written on a regular basis other than when i 've been in school . xxmaj my knowledge of gramatical terms is terrible which might be detected from time to time . xxmaj although i seem to be able to communicate without any larger difficulties . xxmaj in conclusion : xxmaj it seems i 've got my work cut out for me for at least the next two years ahead . xxmaj hopefully i 'll learn to master things and tackle my weak spots quickly . xxmaj after that there are other challenges that need to be attended to . xxfld 2 ﻿ xxmaj in the name of xxmaj religion , you can get away with anything ! xxmaj with this argumentative piece i 've tried to shed a light on the consequences of religion . xxmaj what goes on , apart from all of the good deeds man does in the name of religion . i 've devided them in five headings , all regarding different aspects of the topic . i myself am not a believer . i 'm a naturally born critic or sceptic , if you will . i firmly believe that it should be up to every man / woman to inividually process information and facts that are given or thrown upon us . xxmaj just because something has been going on for a long period of time does n't necessarily mean it 's alright . 1 ) xxmaj religion is prohibiting . xxmaj it compromises the person . xxmaj religion prevents individual thinking and persuades mankind to accept and \" buy the whole concept \" of its ideas in the scriptures . xxmaj the scriptures compromise peoples prerogative to think for themselves , they roothlesly rob people of their natural ability to evaluate and act on their own intuition . xxmaj religion makes the individual fall in line and not to question anything it says . xxmaj is that a good thing , i ask ? xxmaj is compromising yourself necessary , in the name of religion ? 2 ) xxmaj religion causes conflicts . xxmaj lets look at religion in a passed - present - future perspective . i do n't think i 'm going out on a limb if i point out that more or less all wars , some excluded originates from religious grounds and believes . xxmaj the discontent of people who do n't agree with you or do n't share your believes causes conflicts in the name of religion . 3 ) xxmaj religion prevents individual freedom . xxmaj in the end of 1980 , an xxmaj irish - catholic girl was brutaly raped and got pregnant . xxmaj she suffered in agony for she wanted to have the foetus removed but her religion forbids abortion . xxmaj her case was globaly acknowledged in the media and many , myself included felt for her and witnessed the madness , in the name of religion . xxmaj the bible , an ancient book of moral clauses and devises for a pure way of life , said she could n't have an abortion . xxmaj luckely she could get help in xxmaj england and have the abortion done there . xxmaj imagine if she had n't , what life would that child have led ! ? 4 ) xxmaj religion discriminates . xxmaj sure , it unifies certain people who share the same ideology . xxmaj on the other hand it condems different genres even within the same religion and thus the people who do n't agree with them . xxmaj people who do n't share their point of view or religious believes . xxmaj is it righteous to commit cruel actions as long as it is in the name of religion ? 5 ) xxmaj religious downpayment ! ? xxmaj even in the early days you were able to go to your church and seek repentance for your sins . xxmaj you mearly went to a priest and confessed and he would gladly give it to you . xxmaj he might suggest that you ought to do a few xxmaj hail xxmaj mary 's and suddenly in an instance you had been forgiven . xxmaj back then you could even assure your place in heaven when buying a letter of indulgence . xxmaj buy your way into the xxmaj lords glory , heaven , kingdom or what ever you preferred . xxmaj today 's version of that same phenomena is called xxmaj televangelism . xxmaj the 80 's way to repentance . xxmaj televised fundraisings , usually held by a spiritual leader of some kind . xxmaj he would very convincingly encourage the viewers to support his \" cause \" , by donating obnoxiously large sums of money to him and the \" cause \" . xxmaj the cause might be o an honest nature , to build evangelist churches or help the poor . xxmaj but in some cases they were spend for personal gain by the so called prophet . xxmaj outrageous news of spiritual leaders spending their money on prostitutes and extramarital affairs . xxmaj these people who are supposed to set an example to their followers . i guess their only human , but it ca n't feel all that to be good old xxmaj mrs xxmaj lewis in the south of xxmaj california , who recently donated a large sum to \" reverend xxmaj chastity \" , and learn that he has spent \" her \" money on questionable things , can it ! ? xxmaj it 's a strange world we live in where some people profits from other peoples misery . xxmaj conclusion : xxmaj imagine a world without prejudice of religion , race , colour or believes ! xxmaj almost impossible to picture i know . xxmaj religion should be more humble and \" human \" , it should serve as a medium that brings people together , not to discriminate . i 'm not saying that it should be removed or terminated , because many people need to be able to put their trust in a supreme being . xxmaj it needs to be altered / changed or modified , since everything else has been in order to fit in in today 's society . xxmaj many vicious things have been done , is being done and will be done in the name of religion . xxmaj it is not acceptable ! xxup take xxup action !, Text xxbos xxfld 1 xxunk to the increasing violence that we 're daily exposed to , a need to take action has arisen . xxmaj television broadcasters and cable suppliers have been asked to xxunk a computer - chip ( the v - chip ) . xxmaj this chip will enable parents to protect their children from \" the rude xxunk of the xxunk \" ( xxup g. \n",
       " xxmaj the v - chip will read encoded signals from the suppliers and on scale from one to four parents may determine what should be allowed on their television - sets and what should n't . xxmaj gina xxmaj bellafante , writes about the v - chip in xxup time xxmaj magazine , xxmaj july , 24 , 1995 under the topic \" locking out violence \" . xxmaj using the article in question as a xxunk , i have chosen to address the v - chip aspect and to emphasize my very personal views on its purpose and usage . \" xxmaj we 're not suggesting this is a perfect solution . xxmaj all we 're doing is offering something to parents who have to be in the work force \" , says xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj james xxmaj xxunk , in regards to the v - chip . xxmaj first of all i must say that i find it appalling , the way we wrongly use our television - sets as xxunk ! xxmaj in my meaning there are already far too many parents today who more or less park their kids in front of the xxup tv when they do n't know what to do with them , as it is . xxmaj the v - chip may very well succeed in shutting - out violence broad xxunk on xxup tv , but at the end of the day what it all comes down to is parental responsibility . xxmaj that we as parents make sure that our beloved children are n't exposed to violence . a v - chip would of course be very convenient , but is it really necessary ? xxmaj no ! i propose that instead we all should get more involved in our children 's leisure activities , is n't it our responsibility as parents to actually bring up our children and not to just do so at our own convenience , when it xxunk us . xxmaj could it be that we are lead behind the light by \" the marketing - people \" into spending money on something totally unnecessary , such as the v - chip ? xxmaj this remark since by now we humans have learnt to master the skill of coming up with inventions , gadgets and things developed and designed to \" ease \" our lives , to create a need for something that we could more or less be without ! xxmaj who could have predicted for example that the xxunk - phones would become such an important device , fifteen years ago ? a device of such importance that some people hardly can bare to do without nowadays ? xxmaj we humans have become to comfortable , things have to be simplified and xxunk to fit in into our quest for xxunk . xxmaj next comes the question of alternatives , and if there are any ? i say , xxup yes of course there are , how did people manage in the old days when there were no xxmaj tele 's or kindergartens , they brought their kids with them . xxmaj do we actually have to find a xxunk to help us out here ? xxmaj kids should n't be at home watching tele all the time anyway , what ever happened to playing xxunk , spending time with your family and friends or simply talking to one - another ? xxmaj children of today 's materialistic society grow up lacking social skills , which we can easily detect , in say , the way we talk to eachother , the lack of sympathy and respect for other people than yourself . xxmaj now we have to take affirmative action so that we do n't allow our children to grow up as monsters , xxunk and / or lost souls without emotions . xxmaj last but not least there is the aspect of supervising people and xxunk on their right to privacy . i presume that the xxmaj broadcasters wo n't be too happy about the v - xxmaj chip either , since they stand to loose a lot of their viewers . i think that they will strongly and xxunk object to the suggestion in question . i find myself agreeing with xxmaj senator xxmaj robert xxmaj dole on his statement on the v - xxmaj chip . xxmaj he feels that the v - xxmaj chip is yet another step closer to the government getting control on what we see on television . i feel and many with me that it should be up to every person for himself to chose what he or she wants to watch on xxup tv . xxmaj as long as it is not illegal , of course . xxmaj the fact of it is that if we install a v - xxmaj chip we will probably not be able to see the news either , since they have a lot of nasty xxunk in some of their xxunk features . xxmaj who knows what will be left to see , even xxmaj donald xxmaj duck is violent in the cartoons ! xxmaj conclusion : xxmaj generalisation and casting people into the same xxunk is never the way to go about anything , it only feeds discontent and xxunk ! xxmaj if the v - chip comes through , which i hardly think it will , or has it , since the article dates back some five years , i find it sad . i am sorry to say that it seems we are not capable of taking care of our offspring 's or manage without xxunk devices . xxmaj it 's a sad world to live in , when everything is about quantity and not quality , we will have to endure the consequences of our actions surely in the future . xxfld 2 ﻿ xxmaj in the name of xxmaj religion , you can get away with anything ! xxmaj with this argumentative piece i 've tried to shed a light on the consequences of religion . xxmaj what goes on , apart from all of the good deeds man does in the name of religion . i 've devided them in five headings , all regarding different aspects of the topic . i myself am not a believer . i 'm a naturally born critic or sceptic , if you will . i firmly believe that it should be up to every man / woman to inividually process information and facts that are given or thrown upon us . xxmaj just because something has been going on for a long period of time does n't necessarily mean it 's alright . 1 ) xxmaj religion is prohibiting . xxmaj it compromises the person . xxmaj religion prevents individual thinking and persuades mankind to accept and \" buy the whole concept \" of its ideas in the scriptures . xxmaj the scriptures compromise peoples prerogative to think for themselves , they roothlesly rob people of their natural ability to evaluate and act on their own intuition . xxmaj religion makes the individual fall in line and not to question anything it says . xxmaj is that a good thing , i ask ? xxmaj is compromising yourself necessary , in the name of religion ? 2 ) xxmaj religion causes conflicts . xxmaj lets look at religion in a passed -

to - date statistics and then mention some different varieties of xxmaj english and explain the terms xxmaj pidgins and xxmaj creoles . i find it important to investigate how it is possible for a language spoken by so few at the beginning to become a world language which is quite familiar to so many people . xxmaj my sources are secondary , since it is difficult to find good primary sources on this subject . 2 . xxmaj definition of a world language xxmaj what is a world language ? xxmaj according to the xxmaj swedish xxmaj encyclopaedia xxmaj nationalencyklopedin ( 1996 ) it is a language which is spoken or understood by a considerable number of people around the globe . xxmaj thus languages such as xxmaj chinese ( xxmaj mandarin ) , xxmaj english and xxmaj arabic are world languages , but not xxmaj swedish or artificial languages such as xxmaj esperanto . xxmaj to a large extent the position of a language as a world language depends on the literature ( books , papers and scientific works ) that is written in that language . xxmaj english meets with these criteria and is the dominating world language of today . xxmaj seen from a historical point of view otherlanguages have occupied the position as world languages ; in the 17th and 18th centuries xxmaj french was the dominating language . xxmaj before that xxmaj latin and xxmaj greek dominated in the medieval and ancient xxmaj europe . 3 . xxmaj the spread of xxmaj english xxmaj at the beginning xxmaj english was not a widely spread language . xxmaj in xxmaj shakespeare 's time the number of people speaking xxmaj english was as low as a few millions . xxmaj as the population grew the number of xxmaj english speakers did as well . xxmaj english gradually became the main language of xxmaj wales , xxmaj ireland and the xxmaj scottish xxmaj highlands . xxmaj when the xxmaj english commenced to explore the wide world outside the xxmaj british xxmaj isles the first step on the way to xxmaj english becoming a world language had been taken . xxmaj the xxmaj english began to colonise other continents in the 17th and 18th centuries . xxmaj the xxmaj british settlers spoke xxmaj english , but there were many settlements in the xxmaj new xxmaj world from other nations , and they all spoke their native tongue . xxmaj for a very long time xxmaj english , xxmaj spanish , xxmaj french and xxmaj dutch colonisers fought for the dominance of the xxmaj caribbean and by the early 19th century xxmaj britain had control of a number of the xxmaj west xxmaj indian islands . xxmaj this resulted in xxmaj english becoming the most spoken language of the area . xxmaj the xxmaj english also took control over the xxmaj indian subcontinent and a few years later the xxmaj british colonisation of xxmaj australia took place . xxmaj british rule was established in xxmaj singapore , xxmaj british xxmaj guiana , xxmaj new xxmaj zealand and xxmaj hong xxmaj kong and later on also in parts of xxmaj west xxmaj africa , xxmaj east xxmaj africa and xxmaj southern xxmaj africa ( xxmaj barber 1993:234 - 5 ) . xxmaj the xxmaj english dominance is mainly due to political and economical reasons , e.g. the strength of the xxmaj british xxmaj empire during the 18th and 19th centuries . xxmaj after xxmaj world xxmaj war two the position of the xxup us became increasingly more powerful as regards political , economical , technical , scientific and generally cultural areas . 4 . xxmaj statistics xxmaj english is used in over 70 countries as an official or semi - official language . xxmaj according to xxmaj stora xxmaj focus ( 1987 ) the largest xxmaj english speaking populations are found in the xxup us ( 230 million ) , the xxup uk ( 56 million ) , xxmaj canada ( 17 million ) , xxmaj australia ( 15 million ) , xxmaj new xxmaj zealand ( 3 million ) , xxmaj ireland ( 3 million ) xxmaj south xxmaj africa ( 2 million ) and xxmaj jamaica ( 2 million ) . xxmaj english is the official language in all these countries and has an official status in over 50 more countries with approximately one milliard inhabitants in all . xxmaj the largest of these are xxmaj india , xxmaj pakistan and the xxmaj philippines . xxmaj as a first language xxmaj english is spoken by more than 400 million people all over the world of today . xxmaj another 350 million use it regularly as a second language . a further 100 million speak it more or less fluently as a foreign language and of the estimated 40 million users of the xxmaj internet the majority communicate in xxmaj english . xxmaj since the middle of the 20th century xxmaj english is the language that is most frequently taught at school in most countries all over the world . xxmaj its central position in the international communication is due to the fact that the majority of all scientific publications printed in the world are in xxmaj english . xxmaj for example 2 / 3 of the medical journals published in 1985 were in xxmaj english . xxmaj the main language of books , newspapers , airports and air - traffic control , international business and academic conferences , technology , diplomacy , sport , international competitions , pop music and advertising is xxmaj english . 5 . xxmaj varieties \" xxmaj although xxmaj english has become an international language , it lacks any independent standard codification or description that adequately reflects its international character , \" says xxmaj samuel xxmaj ahulu in his article \" xxmaj general xxmaj english \" ( 1997 ) . xxmaj there are nowadays many varieties of xxmaj english and to discuss them in detail is far too complex to deal with here . xxmaj some of the varieties are ; xxmaj british xxmaj english ( abbreviated xxup rp ; xxmaj received xxmaj pronunciation ) , xxmaj american xxmaj english ( xxup ae ) and xxmaj canadian xxmaj english as well as xxmaj australian , xxmaj new xxmaj zealand , xxmaj south xxmaj african , and xxmaj west xxmaj indian xxmaj english . xxmaj these varieties differ as regards pronunciation , stress , intonation and vocabulary . 6 . xxmaj pidgins and xxmaj creoles xxmaj there are probably well over two hundred xxmaj pidgin- and xxmaj creole - languages in the world today , and they are based on many different languages such as xxmaj french , xxmaj portuguese and xxmaj zulu but the largest number is based on xxmaj english . xxmaj between six and twelve million people are still using xxmaj pidgin languages and between ten and seventeen million are using languages descending from xxmaj pidgins , so called xxmaj creoles . a xxmaj pidgin is an auxiliary language used mainly by people trading with each other when they have no common language . xxmaj the word xxmaj pidgin is thought to be from a xxmaj chinese xxmaj pidgin version of the xxmaj english word business . xxmaj you might say that the xxmaj pidgin is a simplified form of the dominant language . xxmaj the grammatical morphology is simple and the vocabulary is limited . xxmaj maybe the most known xxmaj pidgin is the one of xxmaj papua xxmaj new xxmaj guinea , called xxmaj tok xxmaj pisin , which even is acknowledged in the country 's constitution , although it nowadays more accurately should be described as a xxmaj creole . xxmaj when a xxmaj pidgin develops beyond its role as a trade language and becomes the first language of a social community , it is called a xxmaj creole . xxmaj there is , however , no sharp distinction between a xxmaj pidgin and a xxmaj creole . ( xxmaj yule 1996 , xxmaj barber 1993 ) 7 . xxmaj conclusion xxmaj it is most likely that xxmaj english will continue to keep its position as a world language also in the future . xxmaj no other language shows any signs of threatening xxmaj english as the leading language . xxmaj especially as regards the xxup it - market , which is the most important field of exploration and development in the future , xxmaj english is the dominating language of communication . xxmaj this is due to the fact that the xxup us is the leading state on the market . xxmaj it is extremely advantageous that there is such a language as xxmaj english by which you are able to communicate all over the world . xxmaj english is in truth a world language . xxfld 2 ﻿ xxmaj the xxmaj decline of the xxmaj birth - rate in xxmaj sweden a negative trend that can be observed in the xxmaj swedish society of today is the decline of the birth - rate . xxmaj in 1990 the number of children born in xxmaj sweden was 120 000 , in 1994 it was 110 000 and in 1998 it was as low as 89 000 . xxmaj the number of deceased persons was 95 000 , 92 000 and 93 000 respectively - in other words , there is an excess of deaths over births . xxmaj at the same time the total population of xxmaj sweden increased from 8,6 million people in 1990 to 8,8 million in 1994 and to 8,9 million in 1998 . xxmaj these statistics , which i have obtained from the homepage of the xxup scb , illuminate this trend very clearly . xxmaj but what are the reasons for this phenomenon ? xxmaj the main cause of the low birth - rate is the economic situation . xxmaj it is simply too expensive for many people to bring up children in our society . xxmaj therefore family planning has become usual . xxmaj the possibility to avoid unwanted pregnancies through preventives or the alternative to go through a legal abortion has of course had a very great impact on the birth - rates . xxmaj the child allowance far from cover the loss of income during pregnancy , maternity leave and all other expenses involved when raising a child . xxmaj many couples decide to become parents later in life after having obtained a good job and earned some money and paid off their debts . xxmaj sometimes the decision is made too late and others never reach the point in life when they decide that the time to bring children into the world has come . xxmaj furthermore , women 's position in society has gone through a radical change . xxmaj formerly a woman was expected to give birth to children and take care of the household . xxmaj these were her major tasks in life . xxmaj nowadays women have the opportunity of achieving the same positions in business and professional life as men . xxmaj consequently , this has influenced the female way of life . xxmaj after compulsory school an increasing number of young men and women continue their studies , at university for example . xxmaj the studies often take many years to complete and giving birth to a child during that time is not what most women desire . xxmaj after the studies quite a few women want to make a carrier and when they intend to climb the ladder of success children are not considered convenient . xxmaj thus women neither have the time nor want to raise children . xxmaj it has now become more socially accepted than earlier to have a carrier instead of choosing ordinary family - life if you can not combine them . xxmaj what may the effects of this decline of the birth - rate be ? xxmaj the most terrifying aspect is that it makes the economy of the country weak . xxmaj this may need some further explanation . xxmaj the number of people above the age of 60 was in 1990 18 % of the total population in the xxup oecd - countries ( xxmaj organization for xxmaj economic xxmaj co - operation and xxmaj development ) and statisticians have reached the conclusion that the number will be 30 % in 2030 . xxmaj in other words , the number of retired people will increase and thus the state - budgets will have to be used to take care of old people instead of the younger generation . xxmaj this will lead to reduced contributions as regards education and the consequence will be a deteriorated school - system . xxmaj the result will be a generation of people without sufficient education . xxmaj swedish know - how will decrease and thus weaken the xxmaj swedish economy . xxmaj also other contributions , for instance means for the infrastructure and the military , will diminish and the country will slowly begin to decay . xxmaj nevertheless , the troublesome problem with unemployment will fade away when the workers of today retire and their professional posts must be filled . xxmaj provided that the school - system still is satisfactory the young people will have no difficulty in finding jobs . xxmaj this will , hopefully , lead to a rapid development in society and xxmaj sweden will catch up with what was lost during the time of \" depression \" . xxmaj in the long run this decreasing rate of nativity might be very healthy for the economy of the country , but the change should take place at a slower pace than it does at the moment . xxmaj attempts have been made from the government to encourage people to have more children . xxmaj in conclusion this trend of decline of the birth - rate is due to the difficult economic situation of the last years . xxmaj lately signs indicate that the economic situation is improving and if this is the case , the birth - rate most certainly will improve . xxmaj the fact that women make carriers probably does not influence the birth - rate as much as the economic situation does ., Text xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ xxup part - xxup time xxup fathers xxmaj when a relationship has xxunk broken down and separation is inevitable , the children are more often than not the real losers . xxmaj traditionally the child has always lived with the mother after the break - up of the parents . xxmaj there is new trend emerging in xxmaj sweden , however , part - time fathers are becoming more common , that is , the child lives xxunk with his / her father / mother , for example , every second week . i have isolated three different causes that i think could have caused this . xxmaj firstly , the law reforms that have enabled fathers to play a bigger role in their children 's lives . xxmaj secondly , the fathers seem to be more willing to take on more responsibility in raising their children . xxmaj thirdly , both parents seem to have become aware of the importance of the father 's role in the children 's lives . i have based my essay partly on my own views as well as newspaper articles from xxmaj dagens xxmaj nyheter and the book xxmaj sverige xxmaj en xxmaj xxunk och xxmaj social xxmaj historia . xxmaj in 1960s and 1970s marriage and especially de - facto relationships became more common than ever before . xxmaj during the 1970s law reforms took affect which gave men and women equal opportunity to work and take care of their children . xxmaj sweden was unique in that it enabled fathers to go on xxunk leave , although , not many of the men took the opportunity to stay at home and look after their children ( xxmaj sverige p.159 ) . xxmaj in xxmaj october of 1998 another law reform came into affect which gave the courts the right to grant shared custody and alternate living for the child , even if this went against the will of either partner ( xxunk ) . xxmaj the present day situation have changed , however , and with the 1998 law reform more parents have shared custody than they did before . xxmaj the 1998 law reform has given fathers equal opportunity to actively take part in their children 's every - day lives and they now have equal say in how to raise their children . xxmaj the upbringing of a child was almost an exclusive right that the mothers had before , the father normally only spent time with his child on the week - end . xxmaj this created an unrealistic picture in the child 's mind of what a father should be like , he became someone that you only did fun things with . xxmaj for many fathers being a \" week - end - dad \" is not enough and with the new reform they can now play an equally important role in their children 's lives if they want to . xxmaj another development is that both parents are thinking of what is best for their children . xxmaj there seem to be an increased awareness that a child need both parents for his / her psychological well - being . xxmaj some experts argue , however , that alternate living can be detrimental and that it can cause these children to feel that they do not have a permanent situation in their lives . a solution to this would be that the child has only one home , and the parents would be the ones having to move back and forth . xxmaj according to children living in these situations , constant moving and packing of xxunk seemed to be the most negative aspect with having two homes . xxmaj they said that they otherwise felt satisfied and it had not affected them xxunk ) . xxmaj it seems that the children appear quite content with living xxunk with their parents , and xxunk it does not seem that this type arrangement would be harmful for the children . xxmaj shared custody seems to be a good solution to a difficult situation , it is an advantage if a child maintains a healthy relationship with either parent . xxmaj the negative aspect , however , is as i said before that we all need a stable situation . xxmaj ideally would ( of course ) be if the family was one unit , xxmaj but when this is not possible the model of alternative living seems to be a good solution , and it is apparent that these parents are acting in the best interest of their children . xxfld 2 ﻿ \" xxmaj taboo or xxmaj not xxmaj taboo \" xxmaj in the article \" xxmaj cleaning up the language \" by xxmaj shirley e xxmaj peckham , the author takes a clear stand on children who use swear words in their language . xxmaj she has a very conservative view of language and wants it to be like \" in the good old days \" when she was a child . xxmaj what she does not realise is that language is changing all the time ; if it does not change it is dead . xxmaj the part that seems to disturb her the most is that she becomes \" filled with disgust \" when she hears children use bad language . xxmaj furthermore , she is worried that allowing this kind of words will lead to bad language used by everybody in the future . xxmaj she has strong opinions on the use of language but nevertheless she does not have any suggestions on how this matter should be solved . xxmaj one way for xxmaj peckham to solve this matter and make her feel better would perhaps be to try to talk with the children involved . xxmaj unfortunately , it seems like she is of the opinion that children are as disgusting as swear words so i doubt she will ever confront them . xxmaj my experience though , is that it is often a good idea to talk to children about different problems that occur . xxmaj if you talk to them on an appropriate level and do not patronize them you have at least a possibility to change a negative pattern . xxmaj to use the method that xxmaj peckham is suggesting as solution , namely to box a child around his or her ears , is what i would call disgusting . xxmaj peckham has been raised in this manner and perhaps it is the only way she knows to demand respect and to make someone listen to her . xxmaj but to my mind abusing a child by threatening or hitting him or her is not a very constructive or educational way of learning . i do believe that children learn better if they are secure and not scared of the people around them . xxmaj in her article xxmaj peckham also refers to this language as \" foul anti - social \" . i would say that she has misinterpreted the situation completely . xxmaj on the contrary , the language between children in a group is definitely a very social phenomenon . xxmaj by using a certain kind of language it is possible for them to identify themselves with the rest of the group and this is of great importance while growing up . xxmaj in addition i am convinced that most children have the judgement not to use bad language when it is not suitable , for example when they talk to older relatives . xxmaj in contrast to xxmaj peckham , i do believe in children 's ability to adjust to different situations . xxmaj this above - mentioned ability is also the answer to the author 's fear of swear words becoming general practice in the future . xxmaj perhaps is it also a question of maturity . xxmaj this kind of words may be common in children 's language but when they grow up these words usually reduce in number or at least they are not used in public so frequently . xxmaj even xxmaj mrs xxmaj peckham admits that she swore when she was a child , even if she does it reluctantly . xxmaj for her it seems to be a question about swear words being taboo or not taboo and maybe the reason to this is the way she was treated as a child when she swore . xxmaj to sum up i would like to say that it is not so difficult for me to accept children that swear or the words in themselves . xxmaj but to xxmaj mrs xxmaj peckham and the likes of her i can not emphasise enough the importance of verbal communication to solve a matter instead of using violence . xxmaj communication will lead to children feeling safe and is not that what we all want ?]...\n",

the television is an amazing invention and has a lot of good qualities , but where there is good there is evil . xxmaj ten years ago watching television was quite harmless , although violence existed it was not as raw as it is today . xxmaj basically every action - film today contains very much unrealistic violence . xxmaj even the cartoons has a lot of violent elements and what kind of effect does that have on the young viewers ? xxmaj it is no secret that television has a strong impact on its viewers . xxmaj especially children , as they do not always realise what is real and what is fiction . xxmaj to trick a child is not difficult and that is one of the reasons why children - commercials are forbidden in many countries . xxmaj but what is scary is that there is very little restriction towards violent xxmaj tv - shows . xxmaj although there are age - limits and recommended parental xxunk , children have very little trouble to xxunk these restrictions . xxmaj there is an ongoing debate about how to solve this xxmaj tv - violence but very little is actually done . xxmaj adults still want to be able to look at these kinds of films so to ban all xxunk movies would be impossible . xxmaj there is no easy solution to this problem but in the end parents are utmost responsible to protect their children . xxmaj first , i believe we can all agree that violence on xxmaj tv have increased a lot . xxmaj it has become a new kind of entertainment . xxmaj adults find violence entertaining and the film and movie makers respond by adding more and rawer violence and special effects . xxmaj adults can see the difference between real life and fiction . xxmaj but children lack in experience and are often xxunk see the difference . xxmaj so xxmaj tv becomes reality and this can be observed by watching xxunk . xxmaj it is no longer innocent games , it can clearly be seen that television has had impact on them and children express feelings while playing . xxmaj today boys play \" action - man \" and girls play \" model \" , nobody is interested in playing \" house \" anymore . xxmaj television reflects society and violence have increased not only on xxmaj tv but also in real life . xxmaj one can wonder why is that so ? xxmaj are people more evil today then ten years ago ? xxmaj how big part does television actually play ? xxmaj this issue raises more questions than answers but it is an important subject and it must be discussed , as we xxunk it to the children . xxmaj one thing that could be done to protect the children is to broadcast violent films at a late hour , rather than displaying it during daytime . xxmaj here the responsibility lie on broadcasting companies however , parents must also take responsibility and really see to it that their children do not stay up late . xxmaj secondly , what kind of effect does too much television - violence have on children and young adults ? xxmaj in society today there has been a huge increasing rate of violent related crimes . xxmaj but what is new about these crimes are that the xxunk and thieves are teenagers . xxmaj what can be said about these teenagers are that they have got a twisted picture about society and reality . xxmaj they take role models from films and these men and woman from \" xxmaj hollywood \" have very little to do with reality . xxmaj what can be said about these role models is that they are \" xxunk \" and can do anything they want . xxmaj when teenagers xxunk these models the outcome is often wrong . xxmaj it is not right to hurt people physically and you can not drive a car threw a xxunk and get away with it . xxmaj still , one must say that television is a good thing after all . xxmaj television is educating and one can get news and information from all over the world . xxmaj however , there are still many things to improve . xxmaj it is not necessary with all this violence but there is no easy solution to this problem . xxmaj but first we must realise that it really is a problem and that it can not be ignored . xxmaj because what will happen to the youths if they continue to consume five hours of violence every day ? xxmaj they will become people without respect and with a twisted picture of life . xxmaj we must do something about this now before it is to late . xxfld 2 xxup ﻿i have now studied xxmaj english for nine years in school and am now capable of evaluating my knowledge in this interesting language . xxmaj my xxmaj english skills have been affected and somewhat improved by the fact that i attended the xxmaj english xxmaj class in the xxmaj swedish gymnasium , and i have also taken the xxmaj cambridge xxmaj certificate in xxmaj advanced xxmaj english . i will now mention some of the strengths and weaknesses i consider i have in the language . xxmaj it took a while before i decided whether i should speak with a xxmaj british or an xxmaj american accent . i believe that i can speak both fairly well , although there was a period of time when i mixed the two . i finally decided on the xxmaj american accent , mainly because i spoke a lot of xxmaj english with my xxmaj canadian cousin during her one year long visit in xxmaj sweden . xxmaj it also feels more relaxed and natural for me , than the xxmaj british accent which sometimes feels a bit too formal . xxmaj in my opinion i sound a bit affected when i try to speak xxmaj british . xxmaj some words are slightly more tricky to pronounce in xxmaj american than in xxmaj british xxmaj english , though , for instance the way you pronounce the \" r \" sounds . xxmaj it is especially difficult when the \" r \" appears in the middle of a word , in that case it is easy to put too much emphasis on it which makes it difficult to continue saying the word in a natural way . xxmaj fortunately this problem is diminishing the more i speak . xxmaj when it comes to reading i have become a lot better at xxunk and xxunk xxmaj english texts during the past few years . i can find the important things i 'm looking for faster , and can easier get an overview of what a text is about . i find it amusing to read passages of books out loud for myself , especially poems and paragraphs worth considering . xxmaj this is also a good way of practicing my speech . xxmaj unfortunately i 'm a bit lazy when i come across words i do n't recognize . xxmaj instead of looking them up in a dictionary i tend to try and figure out what the word means by its context . xxmaj this is not a good way if i want to improve my vocabulary , but i do try to get better and recently i have started to look most of the words up . xxmaj when i listen to other people speaking xxmaj english i rarely have a hard time to follow . xxmaj listening to other people speaking and understanding what they are saying is usually the easiest part when you are learning a new language . i can also understand different accents of xxmaj english to a rather large extent . xxmaj when i do listening comprehension i can easily make significant notes while still listening , but it happens that i lose my concentration and my mind starts to xxunk . i have always found it pretty easy to write both in xxmaj english and xxmaj swedish . xxmaj it usually xxunk well as i write , although it might not always be perfectly accurate . i write the assignment or essay relatively fast , but then i like having time to read it through a number of times , preferably during a period of time xxunk over a couple of days . xxmaj in that way i can make corrections and maybe find alternative words in some of the sentences , which is easier to do the more times you have read it through . i seldom make large spelling errors when writing by hand , i usually see if a word is spelt correctly . xxmaj the structure in my texts are not always satisfactory , but i am trying to work on that . xxmaj it improved some as i took the xxmaj cambridge course , but it can always become better . i 'm not totally familiar with punctuation when writing in xxmaj english , it 's sometimes difficult to know when to put the xxunk in . xxmaj the thing i know the least about when it comes to xxmaj english is grammar . xxmaj throughout my school years i have always been among the lucky ones who usually can hear if a sentence sounds correct or not and have therefore never bothered to learn the different rules . i now regret my lack of attention in that area , and i have to put in some extra effort to learn it now instead ., Text xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ \t xxmaj today there is nothing strange or odd about being vegetarian , on the contrary , it shows that you have some moral and ethical values or a philosophical ideology that you live up to , xxunk has become a trend in the western society . i will refer to the trend as xxunk even though we should be aware of the different directions , for instance there are those who eat milk and egg products , those who do not eat meat but they eat fish and those who do not eat anything that comes from the animal world . xxmaj if you were a vegetarian fifteen years ago you were the strange one . xxmaj today every xxunk restaurant has at least one vegetarian dish on their xxunk , even xxmaj mc xxmaj xxunk have vegetarian alternatives to their xxunk . xxmaj fifteen years ago the xxmaj indian restaurants were the only place you could go to if you wanted to order something more than a xxunk xxunk . xxmaj you also had to do some research about nutrition to be sure that you got everything your body needed , today you can buy frozen vegetarian ready - xxunk food with all the different substances your body requires and the different alternatives are almost as many as the non vegetarian alternatives . xxmaj the reasons why you become vegetarian are more or less the same now as then , some examples are : reaction against how the animals are treated , ideological believes and health problems . xxmaj the question is why ? xxmaj what is it that has changed during this last 15 years ? i have found three different reasons that together have contributed to cause the trend . xxmaj this process was started some fifteen years ago , when we all learned how chickens were treated . xxmaj media realised the potential of the issue and have informed us since about many of the horrible situations that animals are subjected to before slaughter . xxmaj this is one of the reasons why many became vegetarians , but it also caused the market forces to react and it was suddenly alright to pay more for animals living in relative good circumstances . xxmaj still , we have been reached by several alarming reports these last years and they have shown that it can be dangerous to eat meat due to the different products that animals are filled up with , some of them in order to prevent xxunk and diseases , other to lower the production costs . xxmaj some examples of this are for instance the xxunk stuffed xxunk , the xxunk treated pigs and the crazy cows . xxmaj another reason is the modern society we live in , today we can import and eat any fruit or vegetable at any time of the year thanks to the modern communication which makes us less dependent on meat . xxmaj at the beginning it was very expensive to live on vegetables and only the rich and educated could afford it . xxmaj xxunk became a hip and healthy lifestyle and the most distinguished xxunk were challenged by the novelty of this area which made xxunk to something exclusive . xxmaj the xxunk and xxunk disappeared when the average consumer claimed his right to this lifestyle and the market had to adjust itself to the demand and supply . xxmaj to be a vegetarian today is not necessarily associated to a certain class , it is a general awareness of our bodies and our health and many eating disorders are symptoms of this physical awareness . xxmaj lastly we have the environmental awareness . xxmaj the high production of meat has caused an over - production of xxunk manure , which combined with air and water becomes the acid xxunk that xxunk our environment . xxmaj today 's generation is well aware of the environmental situation that they have inherited and by consuming less meat the production must eventually decrease . xxmaj forests have been cut down in order to create more xxunk land so if this generation had not reacted it might have been too late for the next generation . xxmaj as we can see the consumers are the ones who can make the market change and the market makes consumers change . xxmaj those who reacted against the poor circumstances animals lived in some fifteen or twenty years ago xxunk way for today 's xxunk by forcing the market to offer something better that gave us a clean consciousness . xxmaj this is what i see as the great cause to this trend . xxmaj the market has had to adjust itself to the consumers at the same time as they have managed to create a whole new vegetarian food market , today it is profitable to sell less meat and more vegetarian alternatives . xxmaj we want to feel good about ourselves and the market wants to make money . xxmaj today it is easy to live well and feel good about yourself and that is why the xxunk has become a trend in our societies , we can eat vegetarian xxunk , xxunk and xxunk that taste as the xxunk so we do not have to feel as if we xxunk anything at the time as the market is making its money . xxmaj but there are also those who see xxunk as a part of xxmaj darwin 's evolution of species and if that is the case perhaps this is not only a trend . xxfld 2 ﻿ xxmaj the number of xxunk phones in xxmaj sweden still increases xxmaj everywhere you go you see people talking in xxunk phones . xxmaj in xxmaj sweden today , the xxunk phone has become even more common than the ordinary xxunk telephone ; in the autumn of 1999 , xxunk to numbers then presented by the xxmaj swedish government , nearly 5 million xxmaj swedes - about 55 per cent of the xxmaj swedish population - owned at least one xxunk phone each . xxmaj this means that the number of xxunk phones has gone from practically zero to five million in only ten years . xxmaj and maybe even more extraordinary is the fact that the number just keeps increasing . xxmaj what could be the reason for this continuing boom ? xxmaj without doubt one reason is that many people want to be xxunk as often as possible . xxmaj for instance they may have jobs where it 's absolutely essential that they are xxunk at any time of the day . xxmaj the xxunk phone becomes an important part of their jobs and they would n't make it without it . xxmaj and i 'm certain that one reason why so many teenage girls and boys are equipped with xxunk phones is that parents want to be able to reach their children as soon as the slightest trace of worry emerges in their easily worried parental minds . xxmaj they do n't mind paying for a phone , but see it as some kind of insurance . xxmaj furthermore , this habit of being xxunk is xxunk - once you 've tried it , it 's hard to stop . xxmaj once you 've bought your first xxunk phone , you may be hooked . xxmaj on the other hand , a great deal of people do n't like to be xxunk all the time , and they are less likely to buy xxunk phones . xxmaj so the xxunk part ca n't be the only reason for the huge number of xxunk sold in xxmaj sweden . xxmaj another reason could be - fashion . xxmaj the xxunk phone has become more than just a phone . xxmaj today the little piece of electronic parts comes in various shapes and colors , equipped with many other functions than those of an ordinary telephone . xxmaj to many people being the owner of the newest , \" hottest \" xxunk phone is just as important as having xxunk fashionable clothes . xxmaj when a model gets too old , it 's a must to replace it with a xxunk one . xxmaj there 's no doubt that the manufacturers of xxunk phones have succeeded in their advertising and marketing - when a new model is about to be released onto the market , the excitement of the public can almost be compared to that of people at some car fair when xxmaj xxunk is about to present a new family car . xxmaj but then again , there of course is a great number of people who do n't care about being in fashion . xxmaj so why do these people also purchase xxunk phones ? a rather important reason , naturally , is the price . xxmaj ten , or even five years ago , a xxunk phone was much more expensive than it is today . xxmaj at the beginning of the xxunk the xxunk phone was considered an article of luxury , owned by very important and / or very rich people only . xxmaj today , this is not the case at all and the prices continue to fall , allowing more and more people to buy xxunk phones of their own . xxmaj however , the phones may be cheaper , but the bills can become rather unpleasant if you use the phone frequently . xxmaj and suppose xxunk were as cheap as xxunk phones - would that mean that everybody would buy a xxunk ? xxmaj that does n't sound very probable . xxmaj so even if the price is right , there must be another , more important reason for all this phone - buying . xxmaj since the beginning of time , man has strived for communication with other people - not only for business but also for pleasure and leisure . xxmaj the means have varied a lot - smoke signals were used by the indians , cave paintings even earlier and the xxmaj xxunk code only recently surrendered to more modern means of communication , just to mention a few . xxmaj and communication is still the thing that keeps everything going in our society . xxmaj consequently , the most important reason for the still increasing number of xxunk phones in xxmaj sweden is the people 's will to communicate - especially since it 's possible to do it at a reasonable cost and with an easy - to - use portable device . xxmaj quite simply - people want and need to talk to each other , and if the preferred \" face - to - face \" mode is n't available , there is always the possibility of using a xxunk phone . xxmaj about ten years ago many people thought that the xxunk phone was just a xxunk . xxmaj they turned out to be wrong . xxmaj and the manufacturers of xxunk phones are still optimistic . xxmaj they xxunk an increase of their products in people 's homes and pockets . xxmaj and as long as xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk keep coming up with new functions in their portable xxunk their xxunk probably will come true . xxmaj because people will keep communicating - be that by speech , text or pictures ., Text xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ xxmaj this is an argumentative essay against xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson 's debate xxunk where he asserts that the xxmaj monarch and the xxmaj royal family should be xxunk by the committee on the constitution of the xxmaj swedish xxmaj riksdag . xxmaj johansson presents three main arguments ; xxmaj his most important argument is that the constitutional xxmaj xxunk agreement from xxunk xxunk that the xxmaj monarch 's duties should be strictly xxunk and representative but there is no control whether the xxmaj monarch , with family , act xxunk or not . xxmaj they should be xxunk just as the xxmaj government or the xxmaj bank of xxmaj sweden . xxmaj another argument is that the xxmaj swedish people have chosen the xxmaj monarchs as their international representatives , but they can not really represent a whole country if they take sides in controversial issues . xxmaj lastly , xxmaj johansson argues that xxmaj sweden 's international reputation is harmed by their statements . xxmaj as i see it this is certainly not a matter for the committee on the constitution as there are other more important issues to xxunk . xxmaj in xxmaj sweden the xxmaj monarch 's role is merely representative according to the constitutional agree from xxunk ; xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk agreement . xxmaj the xxmaj monarchy should not play a political role or make important decisions . xxmaj but we should also keep in mind that half the world is ruled by xxmaj monarchies or xxmaj xxunk and to communicate with those countries the xxmaj monarch is the only alternative . xxmaj to send the minister xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk for instance , that is ' only ' a minister and besides a woman can result as offensive and provoking to some of these countries . xxmaj many xxmaj xxunk countries do only have a ' king - to - king ' communication and in such cases the xxmaj monarch has far greater influence than the constitution would like to recognise . xxmaj neither can i agree with his last argument as i do not believe that their statements can hurt our international reputation more than we already do ourselves by our behaviour at the holiday xxunk . xxmaj johansson has used xxmaj queen xxmaj xxunk as an example . xxmaj she stated in an interview that she was surprised that the xxmaj xxunk sent out their children to throw stones at the xxmaj israeli police . xxmaj this arose a great attention in the xxmaj arab world . xxmaj the xxmaj queen works actively for children 's rights , she has initiated a xxmaj childhood xxmaj foundation ; xxmaj she supports organisations that work for the improvement of children 's rights all over the world and is an xxmaj xxunk member of \" xxmaj xxunk \" and other similar xxunk . xxmaj but the xxmaj queen also represents the xxmaj swedes , and in xxmaj sweden we would never allow our children to risk their lives . i believe it is the xxmaj queen 's obligation to react against all sort of child abuse , as for instance the xxmaj xxunk children 's involvement in the conflict . xxmaj as long as there is not a serious divergence from the xxmaj swedish public opinion they should have the right to react against and comment on public matters . xxmaj the xxmaj king 's statement that the mad cow debate was exaggerated falls on its own absurdity , but still i do not believe that his statement xxunk our reputation or that it should influence politically . xxmaj if anything , he has made a fool of himself . xxmaj the committee on the constitution should xxunk the public sector , they should do something about the political contempt and strengthen the democracy instead of wasting their time on the xxmaj monarchs ' xxunk . xxmaj it is far more important to examine what the politicians do with our tax money , if they really use them to improve our society or if they put it in their own pockets . xxmaj it is also important to check those big international affairs as for instance the xxmaj south xxmaj african xxunk . xxmaj the committee on the constitution should make sure that the governing and decision - making institutions follow the constitution . xxmaj there is no reason to spend time and money xxunk the xxmaj monarchs since they do not possess any power . xxmaj the arguments xxmaj johansson has presented are neither important nor relevant enough to become a task for the committee on the constitution . xxmaj as long as the xxmaj monarchs do not do anything that differs from the xxmaj swedish people 's will there is no reason why the xxmaj monarchs should be xxunk . xxmaj sweden is a small nation and there are very few opportunities for the xxmaj swedish people to express their attitude and therefore the xxmaj monarchs should be able to voice it for us as our representatives . xxmaj if the committee on the constitution is to xxunk the xxmaj monarchs there should be an xxunk to the constitution where the role of the xxmaj monarchs is clearly established . 1

practiced once a week in a gym using shoes as xxunk . xxmaj we played a couple of xxunk in small halls using even smaller goals without xxunk and only three players from each team were allowed to play at the same time . xxmaj we stopped playing after a couple of months . xxmaj now , fourteen years later , i 've played for seven years and the game is quite different from that of 1987 . xxmaj xxunk are nowadays played with five xxunk players and a xxunk for each team . a board surrounds the field and the sticks weigh 130 xxunk compared to 350 xxunk in the old days . xxmaj in xxmaj uppsala we have one of the biggest xxunk halls in xxmaj sweden with three fields in the same building . xxmaj the number of xxunk players in xxmaj uppland has risen from about 120 in 1987 to 2 xxunk in 1992 and 6 xxunk in 2000 . xxmaj one of the major factors is that the number of players that are younger than sixteen has risen from xxunk ( 27 % of total ) in 1992 to 4 192 ( xxunk % of total ) in 2000 . xxmaj how come a sport like xxunk has grown this quickly ? i remember what it was like when i started to play . xxmaj we all wanted to imitate our idols and when you played xxunk it was of course the hockey stars that we wanted to copy . xxmaj players like xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj kent xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk were hot items . xxmaj now , when the sport has grown , you can hear the young players saying that they are xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , two of xxmaj sweden 's best players , both born in xxmaj uppsala . xxmaj when xxunk was introduced it looked like a nice and calm way to play ice hockey . xxmaj there is not that much close contact as in hockey where you learn how to tackle others . xxmaj in xxunk there only minor xxunk are used and this fact probably makes parents of ten years olds less worried when they see their sons and daughters play . xxmaj is it likely that money is of importance to this increase ? xxmaj xxunk is a rather cheap sport to exercise . a stick does n't have to cost more than 200 xxup sek and most of us already own a pair of training shoes . xxmaj this is pretty much what you need if you are going to play . xxmaj if you compare to tennis a xxunk costs almost 800 xxup sek for an eleven - year - old . xxmaj to spend that amount you have to buy one the most expensive sticks you can find . a membership in a club does not have to be that terrible either even though it can differ a great deal between different clubs . xxmaj usually 200 xxup sek for one year is enough , while in tennis you have to pay 1 000 xxup sek for half a year . xxmaj parents , though , do not care that much if it is really expensive , they want their kids to have fun and to meet friends . xxmaj the kids also do not really care if their stick costs 150 xxup sek or 400 xxup sek , as long as they can play with it . xxmaj the best thing , by far , about xxunk , as a youth sport , is that it is a team sport . xxmaj as in every team sport the team spirit is important . xxmaj in what way , then , does xxunk differ from other team sports ? xxmaj it 's simple . xxmaj the fact is that everyone is allowed to play in the xxunk and have fun . xxmaj there is no talk of using the best player twice as much as the rest of the team ; instead everyone plays almost equally much even if this might cause a loss to the team . xxmaj this is if not unique at least a rather unusual way of dealing with team sports . xxmaj in the sports where there is a chance of a player getting professional status , players can be sorted out as early as when they are seven years old . xxmaj in xxunk there is no rejection or segregation of players at a young age instead everyone is allowed to participate as much as they can . xxmaj if i were a parent i would be really happy to see my kid play in the match even though he or she may not contribute that much to the outcome . xxmaj at least they are enjoying themselves and that is what really matters . i think that the number of people playing xxunk will continue to rise , but probably not as rapidly . xxmaj one thing that you can notice regarding the number of players is that if the total is increased by 300 the youth would rise by 250 . xxmaj this is very encouraging for the future and as long as xxunk continues to be generous to its youngsters it will attract new members . xxfld 2 ﻿ \" xxmaj the rise and the fall of the xxmaj swedish school system \" xxmaj at the beginning of the twentieth century xxmaj sweden was a country where both teachers and students were highly respected . xxmaj it was also a country where many poor parents shared a dream , namely to be able to send at least one of their children to school . xxmaj these parents and children knew that a good education was of great importance since it gave every child , whether he or she was rich or poor , the same opportunities to get a well paid job . xxmaj they also knew how to appreciate a good teacher , since he or she would be the one to lead their children into a brighter future . xxmaj unfortunately this beautiful picture has changed . xxmaj today , when our century is approaching its end , people no longer regard nine years of compulsory school as something important nor something to be proud of . xxmaj these nine years are rather seen as a boring episode which leads either to an xxunk job or another dull three years at upper secondary school . xxmaj nevertheless , many seven - year - olds still have great expectations before beginning first grade . xxmaj sadly enough they soon find out that school is far from what they expected it to be . xxmaj the image of a well - organised classroom with a smiling and helpful teacher who has time for every single student simply no longer exists . xxmaj what a student , in xxmaj sweden in 1999 , can expect is a classroom with too many pupils , old schoolbooks , an xxunk and overworked teacher and an attitude towards school as something boring and useless . xxmaj but it is not only the attitude towards school that has changed , but also the attitude towards teachers . xxmaj instead of mentors who xxunk the future of their students , teachers are rather seen as a xxunk who xxunk about homework . xxmaj so , what has gone wrong ; why does nobody no longer seem to respect or enjoy school ? xxmaj in an open letter to one of xxmaj sweden 's largest newspapers the xxmaj swedish xxmaj liberal xxmaj party , xxmaj folkpartiet , blames the governing parties . xxmaj according to xxmaj folkpartiet one of the major reasons for this change of attitude is that politicians have tried to create a school were all children are at the same level . xxmaj they have tried to create a school where all students are given the exact same opportunities and where no student should feel that he or she is not as bright as his or her fellow students are . xxmaj although this certainly sounds like a very beautiful idea it has , however , not quite worked out the way that the politicians had planned it . xxmaj in their striving to create the perfect school , they have failed xxunk . xxmaj what has happened is that students who work faster than their xxunk have not been given any extra material to work on and have therefore not been given the opportunity to develop . xxmaj some schools have stopped giving out homework since it has been considered unequal and unfair . xxmaj this due to the fact that some students receive more help from their parents when doing their homework , while others more or less have had to manage on their own . xxmaj and perhaps worst of all ; the students who need extra help have not been given it since there is a lack of financial resources and teachers . xxmaj school is no longer considered a place where you learn things , but a place were you either struggle to keep up with your xxunk or just sit and wait , since you do not have anything else to do . xxmaj so , what the politicians really have accomplished to create is : a country in which twenty per cent of the sixteen - year - olds can not read or write properly when they finish ninth grade ; a country which has fewer school days and much less homework than any other xxmaj european country ; and a country where students and teachers seem to have lost respect for one another . xxmaj these are only some of the reasons why people tend to smile when i tell them that i am a student at teacher 's college . xxmaj they simply can not understand why i voluntarily have chosen an xxunk job among people who neither respect me as a person or my occupation , but rather see me as a xxunk . xxmaj this is however not the way i see it . xxmaj what xxmaj sweden needs is a school system which sees every student as an individual and therefore gives these pupils guidance to develop in whatever field they are interested in . xxmaj and if i can work in such a school and can be of any help , then being a teacher will always be my first choice of occupation ., Text xxbos xxfld 1 ﻿ xxmaj let the xxmaj royal family speak organ xxmaj johansson argues , in an article from xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj march 3rd 2001 , that the xxmaj king , and all the members of the xxmaj royal family , should be more or less controlled in what the say to avoid awkward and difficult situations for the xxmaj swedish politicians . xxmaj he bases this on the agreement in xxmaj xxunk xxunk , where it was decided that xxmaj sweden were to remain a xxmaj monarchy but the xxmaj king , or xxmaj queen , were to have no political power and only serve as ceremonial persons . a good agreement , according to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson , since the xxmaj swedish people may want the xxmaj king , but practically no one want him to rule the country . i agree that the xxmaj king should not have any political power , but i do not think it is right to try to limit his statements in political issues even though the xxmaj royal family is an exceptional stepping - xxunk for those who want to turn a debate in some direction . i believe that members of the xxmaj royal family should be able to say anything they want and according to the right of free speech , they can . r xxmaj johansson also uses history to give strength to his proposal . xxmaj he tells us how parliamentary government were introduced in xxmaj sweden and how it was put to a difficult test in 1914 when xxmaj king xxmaj gustav v held his xxunk speech attacking the government which ended with the resignation of xxmaj prime xxmaj minister xxmaj karl xxmaj xxunk . i get the feeling that xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson is afraid that something like that could happen . xxmaj however i can not even imagine xxmaj king xxmaj carl xxup xvi xxmaj xxunk making a speech attacking xxmaj goran xxmaj persson and if it would happen , it is not likely that xxmaj goran xxmaj persson would have to resign . xxmaj you could xxunk say that times have changed and i do not think xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson has to be afraid of the xxmaj king making xxmaj goran xxmaj persson resign . xxmaj xxunk by xxmaj king xxmaj carl xxup xvi xxmaj xxunk 's statement that the debate about the mad - cow disease was exaggerated , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson throws out a question whether it is possible to keep the xxmaj king as a trustworthy symbol for our country if it is obvious that he has chosen a side in a highly controversial matter . i do not see why the xxmaj king 's credibility as a symbol for xxmaj sweden would suffer only because he lets the xxmaj swedish people know what he thinks in a discussed topic . xxmaj should not he , the xxmaj king of xxmaj sweden , be allowed to tell what he believes ? organ xxmaj johansson also reflects over the year 2000 where there were almost only good things said about xxmaj sweden in other countries . xxmaj you could read about the xxmaj holocaust conference and the opening of the xxunk over xxunk . xxmaj one of the negative news was , according to xxmaj johansson , created by xxmaj queen xxmaj xxunk when she , in an interview last xxmaj october , said that she could not understand why xxmaj xxunk sent their children out in the streets to throw xxunk towards the xxmaj israeli police . xxmaj johansson says that the xxmaj queen 's view of the conflict in the xxmaj middle xxmaj east is completely off target and i do not know enough about the conflict to argue with him , but he also says that it was evident that the xxmaj queen had picked a side . xxmaj for me it is not that clear , but what i know of the xxmaj queen 's xxunk is that she is always looking after the children in every situation . xxmaj if she did take the children 's side in that discussion i would not object at all , even though it got big attention in the xxmaj arab world . xxmaj it was , however , unfortunate that there were peace talks between xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj xxunk at that time and that xxmaj sweden was leading the discussions . i still believe in the right of free speech , even for the xxmaj royal family , why should they be an exception ? i can very well agree that both the xxmaj king and xxmaj queen may not always make very clever statements , but it is their right to make statements , clever or not , as any other person . xxmaj if they were not allowed to say anything they wanted it would probably limit their xxunk in different areas . xxmaj imagine the following scenario ; a reporter comes up to the xxmaj king and asks what he thinks of the current unemployment rate in xxmaj sweden . xxmaj the xxmaj king , xxunk to keep neutral in political questions , answers \" xxmaj no comment \" or \" i do not know \" when he instead would like to have said something like \" i think that the government has to do something to lower the unemployment rate \" . a lot of strange situations could arise if the xxmaj royal family was not allowed to comment on political questions . xxmaj all i can say to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson is : xxmaj let the xxmaj royal family speak . xxmaj in an article from xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj march 3rd 2001 xxmaj xxunk xxmaj johansson , a social democratic member of the xxmaj riksdag , argues that the standing committee of the constitution should have power to examine how the head of xxmaj state is handling his duties . xxmaj he demonstrates this by showing different examples of members of the xxmaj royal family making , according to xxmaj mr xxmaj johansson , inappropriate comments in the political world . xxmaj he also backs up his arguments by describing the long and slow process , in which the xxmaj king 's role was reduced to a ceremonial and representative one , towards democracy in xxmaj sweden and implies that we can not let the xxmaj royal family gain any sort of political power . xxfld 2 ﻿ \" xxmaj the rise and the fall of the xxmaj swedish school system \" xxmaj at the beginning of the twentieth century xxmaj sweden was a
